2026-02-11 13:54:28,EU AI Act Analysis,Summarize the requirements for high-risk AI systems.,"### Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems  The requirements for high-risk AI systems are outlined in Chapter 2 of the proposed regulation. These requirements are designed to ensure that high-risk AI systems are safe, respect fundamental rights, and comply with existing laws. The key requirements include:  1. **Data and Data Governance**:    - High-risk AI systems must be developed using high-quality training, validation, and testing data sets that are relevant, representative, free of errors, and complete.    - The data sets must have appropriate statistical properties and take into account the specific geographical, behavioural, or functional setting within which the AI system is intended to be used.    - Providers of high-risk AI systems may process special categories of personal data to ensure bias monitoring, detection, and correction.  2. **Technical Documentation**:    - Providers must draw up technical documentation before placing the AI system on the market or putting it into service. This documentation must be kept up-to-date and demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in Chapter 2.    - The technical documentation must include information on the general characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing, and validation processes, and documentation on the relevant risk management system.  3. **Record-Keeping**:    - High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed with capabilities enabling the automatic recording of events ('logs') while the system is operating.    - The logging capabilities must ensure a level of traceability of the AI system's functioning throughout its lifecycle that is appropriate to the intended purpose of the system.  4. **Transparency and Provision of Information to Users**:    - High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to ensure that their operation is sufficiently transparent to enable users to interpret the system's output and use it appropriately.    - Providers must accompany high-risk AI systems with instructions for use that include concise, complete, correct, and clear information that is relevant, accessible, and comprehensible to users.  5. **Human Oversight**:    - High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed in such a way that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which the AI system is in use.    - Human oversight measures must enable individuals to fully understand the capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI system, remain aware of the tendency to automatically rely or over-rely on the output produced by the system, correctly interpret the system's output, decide not to use the system or otherwise disregard, override, or reverse the output of the system, and intervene on the operation of the system or interrupt the system through a 'stop' button or a similar procedure.  6. **Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity**:    - High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity and perform consistently in those respects throughout their lifecycle.    - The levels of accuracy and the relevant accuracy metrics of high-risk AI systems must be declared in the accompanying instructions of use.    - High-risk AI systems must be resilient as regards errors, faults, or inconsistencies that may occur within the system or the environment in which the system operates, particularly due to their interaction with natural persons or other systems.  These requirements are designed to mitigate the risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights posed by high-risk AI systems and ensure that they are used in a manner that is safe and respectful of existing laws and fundamental rights.",21.7s,aiact.txt
2026-02-11 13:54:58,EU AI Act Analysis,What are the prohibited AI practices according to Article 5?,"The prohibited AI practices according to Article 5 of the EU AI Act include the following:  1. **AI Systems Causing Harm to Human Behaviour**:    - AI systems that deploy subliminal components individuals cannot perceive or exploit vulnerabilities of children and people due to their age, physical or mental incapacities.    - These systems are designed to materially distort the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm to that or another person.    - The intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behaviour results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user.    - Research for legitimate purposes in relation to such AI systems should not be stifled by the prohibition, if such research does not amount to use of the AI system in human-machine relations that exposes natural persons to harm and such research is carried out in accordance with recognised ethical standards for scientific research.  2. **AI Systems Providing Social Scoring**:    - AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons for general purposes by public authorities or on their behalf may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups.    - They may violate the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice.    - Such AI systems evaluate or classify the trustworthiness of natural persons based on their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics.    - The social score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour.    - Such AI systems should therefore be prohibited.  3. **AI Systems for 'Real-Time' Remote Biometric Identification**:    - The use of AI systems for 'real-time' remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is considered particularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights.    - In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in 'real-time' carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.    - The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks.    - Those situations involve the search for potential victims of crime, including missing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State.    - Such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems.    - Moreover, of the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to 'real-time' remote biometric identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.    - In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the use.    - In addition, the use of 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to appropriate limits in time and space, having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims or perpetrator.    - The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the three situations mentioned above.    - Each use of a 'real-time' remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a Member State.    - Such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use, except in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use.    - In such situations of urgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself.    - In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations seek to obtain an authorisation as soon as possible, whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier.    - Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in question has decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of national law.    - Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation.    - The use of AI systems for 'real-time' remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data.    - The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner.    - Therefore, such use and processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.    - In this context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive 2016/680.    - However, the use of 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation.    - Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect to it.    - Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, including where those systems are used by competent authorities in publicly accessible spaces for other purposes than law enforcement, should continue to comply with all requirements resulting from Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable.",29.22s,aiact.txt
