It was painfully brief. And the same could be said for my second… and third looks. Mere glimpses of the beautiful Ligurian coast, each a fleeting snapshot between the blinding darkness of lengthy rail tunnels. My upset with the subterranean tracks didn't last long, however, as I was soon gaping at the full coastal splendour of the Cinque Terre from the village of Vernazza's splendid natural harbour. Cliffs plunged into the sea, forested hills marked the horizon and ancient drystone walls formed twisting terraces above town. And there was not an unsightly train track in view.\n\nThe stunning vistas only grew in magnitude over the coming days as I ran the steep and precipitous coastal trails linking the Cinque Terre's five medieval villages. Mix in some lovely beaches, great Italian seafood and gelato, and the park was a truly rewarding experience.\n\nThis diversity is carried through to Europe's national parks as a whole, and that is what makes them so special. They protect areas of\n\n↓\n\nThe medieval fishing village of\n\nManarola in the Cinque Terre.\n\n↓\n\nDartmoor National Park.\n\n↓\n\nPlitvice National Park.\n\n- ↓ Picos de Europa.\n\ncoast, high-altitude peaks in the Pyrenees and Alps, and even parts of the frozen Arctic, with wildlife ranging from Carpathian squirrels and fin whales to peregrine falcons and polar bears. Setting out to choose Europe's top 60 national parks was no easy task, so we called on our expert writers and well-travelled Destination Editors. We asked them to tell us which parks provide the best experiences and why. The final selections were those that offered something truly unique, often an enthralling mixture of stunning natural beauty, incredible wildlife, fulfilling activities, local culture and (occasionally) a compelling history too. celebration of Europe's top national parks - it's also a Mediterranean's surface! - explain how to get there\n\nBut this book is intended to be more than just a practical introduction to each of them. We highlight the best activities and trails - in the case of PortCros (p226), one of the trails is actually below the and where to stay, show you the wildlife to watch out for, and even suggest itineraries.\n\nWe hope the following pages inspire you to explore more of Europe's wild and wonderful spaces.\n\nMatt Phillips\n\nShutterstock | serenarossi, Getty Images | urbancow, Shutterstock | Nataliia Budianska; Miguel Castans Monteagudo\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-6 -->\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-7 -->\n\nGetty Images | Johner Images\n\n## Abisko National Park\n\nBeyond the Arctic Circle, Abisko is the northern gateway to the legendary Kungsleden (King's Trail) that takes you across 440km of wild Sweden.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-8 -->\n\nI f you stand on top of the alpine massif of Mount Kebnekaise - Sweden's highest mountain - you're looking down at a pristine landscape wrestled from the grip of an ice age. Glaciers still stretch across the flanks of the neighbouring mountains and, while their larger brethren have retreated from the valleys that they once filled completely, the deep, narrow canyons and steep rock walls testify to a violent geological past. Everything is on a larger scale here. You hike for an entire day and realise that you're not even halfway along the Tjäktjavagge valley. Lakes Torneträsk and Akkajaure are like two inland seas. The birch and spruce forests that cover the foothills seem endless.\n\nAbisko National Park came into being in 1909, making it one of the first in Sweden. Forming part of Sápmi, the historic roaming lands of the Sámi that span a large part of northern Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia's Kola Peninsula, Abisko has been home to Sweden's only indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Their hunter ancestors followed the retreating ice into Abisko's valleys after the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, and remains of ancient hearths and pit traps used to capture wild reindeer and elk can still be found today. Centuries ago, the Sámi switched from hunting to herding, and reindeer husbandry is still prevalent in Abisko, divided between the forest Sámi and the mountain Sámi communities and dictated by the seasons. Forest reindeer herding is more stationary, with the forest Sámi moving their reindeer between foraging grounds in the wetlands and coniferous forests. The more nomadic mountain Sámi follow their reindeer along ancient migratory routes from low-lying\n\nbirch and coniferous forests to summer pastures in the mountains, corralling them along the edges of the Kebnekaise range.\n\n↓ Abisko National Park is an ideal place to go dog-sledding. Previous page: cross-country skiing is another way to get around.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Hike under the midnight sun between late May and mid-July. Prepare for mosquitoes in July and August, the warmest, most popular months for hiking. September and October paint the trees gold and red. Ski under the northern lights from November to March.\n\n## Getting there\n\nAbisko is the northern entrance to the 440km Kungsleden (King's Trail) in the very north of Swedish Lappland. The town of Abisko is a 10-minute drive from the trailhead. Kiruna is the nearest airport, two hours' drive away.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n77 Area covered (sq km)\n\n2106\n\nHighest point: Mount Kebnekaise (m)\n\n10,000\n\nYears that the Sámi have lived in the park area\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-9 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Icehotel\n\nStarting as a small igloo-art gallery in 1989, the Icehotel has grown into a winter extravaganza built of ice blocks, its corridors decorated with extraordinary ice sculptures and its rooms created afresh each year by artists. Sleep on beds of compact snow, reindeer skins and army-issue sleeping bags. The main building is surrounded by satellite bungalows with skylights for watching the northern lights, and the restaurant is one of Sweden's best. Dog-sled pickup is available from Kiruna airport in winter.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Seeing the northern lights\n\nOne of the best places on Earth to experience nature's most spectacular light show, with eerie streaks of green, white, red and yellow streaming across the night sky, is the Aurora Sky Station. Chairlifts run to the lookout tower on top of Mount Nuolja between November and March, and its location away from any city lights makes viewing conditions particularly favourable. In winter, Lights Over Lapland runs nightly Aurora Borealis photography tours from Abisko Mountain Lodge, with professional photographers teaching you how to capture the winter night magic.\n\n## STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation\n\nThis mountain lodge has a picturesque location at the foot of Mount Kebnekaise. Superb meals are conjured from locally sourced ingredients. In summer, arrive by helicopter; in winter you can opt for reindeer sled or snowmobile.\n\nSTF Abisko Turiststation &amp; Abisko Mountain Lodge The gateway to Abisko, this lodge draws backpackers with simple dorms and the rest with hotel-style rooms. Guests can treat themselves to three-course gourmet dinners.\n\nExperiencing Sámi life The Sámi village of Rávttas teaches visitors about nomadic Sámi life, which revolves around reindeer. You'll learn to distinguish between individual deer, ride a sleigh (in winter) and indulge in Sámi dishes around an open fire in a traditional lavvus (teepee).\n\nGoing husky sledding Imagine yourself on a sled, shouting commands to your team of baying huskies. They surge past the frozen river and over the pristine landscape, snow flying from under their paws. Brothers Tomas and Andreas at Abisko Fjällturer can teach you everything about mushing.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nIlluminated by the northern lights in winter and the midnight sun in summer, Sweden's northernmost national park is marked by surprisingly mild winters, due to the region's microclimate, and brief, warm summers. Habitats include subarctic forests, alpine rivers, subalpine grasslands and quaking bogs. Larger mammals such as reindeer and moose are diurnal and spotted year round; in winter, tracks on the snow reveal shy wolverines, foxes and lynx. Feathered denizens include golden eagles, buzzards, falcons and a wealth of wading birds.\n\nREINDEER These herbivores can find food even under snow, digging for lichen with their hooves. Domesticated by the Sámi, they graze all over Abisko. Like human fingerprints, no two reindeer antlers are the same.\n\nELK (MOOSE) This immense, solitary herbivore is best spotted at dusk or dawn, when it forages for food. Moose are extremely good swimmers, can dive for underwater plants and can run up to 60km/hr.\n\nWOLVERINE This solitary omnivore that looks like a bear but is the largest member of the weasel family is both diurnal and nocturnal. It feeds on plants, berries and rodents and takes on weakened moose.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-10 -->\n\n/.\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Mount Kebnekaise Reaching the summit of Sweden's highest mountain (2106m), this strenuous 12-hour-return, 20km hike rewards you with allencompassing views of the surrounding tundra.\n\n02 Puddus Nature Trail This easy 14km hike takes you to a reconstruction of a traditional Sámi camp and a former Sámi sacrificial site with awesome Lake Torneträsk views.\n\n## 03 Abisko to Nikkaluokta\n\nThe park's longest hike, this 105km, six-day trail leads you past pristine lakes, along verdant valleys, over the scenic Tjäkta Pass and around the iconic Mount Kebnekaise.\n\nVA,\n\nUUUh\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-11 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nSurvey the Arctic north from the top of Sweden's highest mountain and hike part of Sweden's longest hiking trail. Staying awake under the midnight sun? That too.\n\n↓ Staying in Jukkasjärvi's otherworldly Icehotel is a once-in-alifetime opportunity.\n\na bicycle the following day and take on the 39km-long Rallarvägen (Navvy Rd) to Riksgränsen. It runs parallel to the railway line from Abisko towards the Norwegian border and was used by railwayconstruction workers in the early 20th century. Or, for a shorter biking adventure, take the train to Låktatjåkka and do the 10km return trip to the enormous boulders and rock formations of the Kärkevagge valley, with Trollsjön (Sulphur Lake) its showpiece.\n\n## Two days\n\nGet a taste of the park in the least amount of time by taking the gently undulating, 8km trail from Abisko Turiststation along the Ábeskoeatnu River and then along the left fork of the signposted Kårsavagge trail through birch and pine forest to the tumultuous Kårsa rapids. Then, in the evening, cap the day with a chairlift ride to the Panorama Café at the top of Mount Nuola and watch the midnight sun cast a pearly glow over the lake and forest. Spend the night at Abisko Turiststation, rent\n\n## Three days\n\nOne of Abisko's highlights is following the 19km trail from the park's eastern entrance, Nikkaluokta, to the foot of Mount Kebnekaise. The trail passes Lake Laddjujavre; you can cut 6km from your hike by catching a boat across the lake in summer. From STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation you have a choice of two trails to the summit of Mount Kebnekaise. The Vastra (western) trail is gentler but longer (25km return), while the last part of the shorter Ostra\n\n## A week or more\n\nFor the park's longest hike, take the Kungsleden from Abisko Turiststation. The trail follows the rapids of the Ábeskoeatnu River as it gushes along a narrow canyon, before passing through a vast, gentle valley and then dense beech forest, where wooden boardwalks carry you over bog land and bridges help you traverse streams. You pass several small lakes en route - ideal for skinnydipping first thing in the morning or if no other hikers happen to be passing by! Around 35km from the\n\n(eastern) route (20km return) involves a steep scramble to the summit and sometimes crampons to get across the glacier. The western trail takes you into the Kitteldalen valley and involves fording two streams. Ascend the steep track to Vierramvare, with the summit on your left. If you have the energy on the way down, you can visit the lesser Toulpagorni peak. Recuperate at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation and either retrace your steps to Nikkaluokta or take the daily Kallax Flyg helicopter.\n\nstart, the trail climbs to a mountain ridge, from which you'll have fantastic views of the countryside you've just tramped across. There's a sauna here at Alesjaure cabins to take care of your aches and pains. The highest point of the fiveor six-day trek to Mount Kebnekaise takes you over the Tjäkta Pass (1150m), where you'll occasionally find snow even in June. Take a day to hike up Mount Kebnekaise and then either carry on south along the Kungsleden or walk out to Nikkaluokta.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-12 -->\n\nParco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise\n\n02 I TALY\n\nFor centuries this was Italy's most isolated wilderness, and notoriously shy bears and wolves still roam amid its towering peaks, silent green valleys, cobalt-blue lakes and thick forest.\n\n500px | Daniele De Rubeis\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-13 -->\n\nild poppies flame from the foothills in spring as you approach the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise. Gentle hills give way to steeper slopes, rearing up to the highest points of the Apennine range. Glacial and fluvial gorges trace the violent geological activity that has created these peaks, troughs and chasms. Remote sanctuaries punctuate forgotten-feeling high-altitude valleys, ideal points to contemplate the vastness of nature and your smallness within it.\n\nW\n\nMountain-edged valleys cup lakes that reflect the peaks in their mirrored waters. The small scoop of Lago Vivo partly freezes in the winter chill. A herd of deer scatters as you follow a path upwards. Occasionally you'll pass snub-roofed drystone huts, still used by farmers and shepherds as their livestock roam across the hills. Beech trees dominate the forests, their leaves turning gold, rust and terracotta-red in autumn.\n\nSuch was the isolation of the area that it was for a long time almost inaccessible. Tratturi (long grassy paths) weave across the countryside, linking the Apennines to Puglia in the south. These still-in-use routes were used by the pre-Roman Samnite population and later the Romans. From the 1400s to the 1970s shepherds drove their flocks along these twice annually. In autumn they travelled from the highlands to balmier grazing in Apulia in Italy's deep south, returning up to the cooler pastures in summer. This was the annual transhumance, and today walkers can trace their footsteps across these ancient routes.\n\nIn 1922, the (then) 5 sq km park was founded to protect the area's rare natural riches, from bears to orchids, born of its isolation and inaccessibility, but\n\nthe Fascists abolished the park in 1933. Following the park's re-establishment in 1950, it was gradually expanded to cover the vast, epically wild and diverse 500 sq km of today.\n\n↓ Cycling below Monte Amaro (2793m) - one of the highest Apennine peaks - in nearby Maiella National Park. Previous page: Monte Marsicano (2242m).\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Wild flowers carpet the park from April to June, while in similarly temperate September to October the vast forest turns magnificently gold and red. July and August are hot, and winter's cold and snowy, prime time for winter sports.\n\n## Getting there\n\nIn central Italy, the park is accessible via bus from Avezzano (for connections to L'Aquila, Pescara and Rome), to Pescasseroli, Civitella Alfedena and other villages. The A24 and A25 highways are the closest major roads.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n440\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\nHighest point: Petroso (m)\n\n2249\n\n60\n\nPercentage covered by forest\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-14 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Albergo Antico Borga La Torre\n\nUp a stepped cobbled lane, this 18th-century town house has small geranium-laden balconies. It's in the medieval centre of Civitella Alfedena, a red-roofed, pale-walled small town that spills across the wooded landscape at the foot of a string of Apennine peaks. Rooms have pine furnishings and an oldschool feel, and superb panoramas lift them out of the ordinary. The small restaurant serves hearty local dishes to set you up for the hills, usually with some homemade liquor to finish.\n\n## Do this!\n\nBear watching One of the many thrilling adventures to be had in the park is to take bear-watching excursions with local operators. Some offer middle-of-nowhere accommodation for better bear spotting, in remote mountain lodges set amid snowcapped peaks and emeraldgreen grassy hills. At dusk or in the early morning, as the sun rises and turns the surrounding colours golden, you'll venture out to track and observe bears with an expert local guide, exploring the ancient woodlands, grassy clearings and hidden crevices that are the favourite spots of these retiring creatures.\n\nB&amp;B Animali Selvaggi\n\nIn Pescasseroli, this threebedroom guesthouse has rooms featuring polished-wood antique furniture that belonged to the owners' grandparents. It's also eco-friendly, and all the food for breakfast is organic, plus it caters for vegans.\n\n## B&amp;B La Sosta\n\nThis whitewashed B&amp;B is on the main road below the small town of Opi, which cloaks a hilltop below higher peaks. It's run by a welcoming elderly couple who take pride in their hospitality, offering smart, wellcared-for rooms with balconies.\n\nWolf howling Wolf howling was a technique used by hunters in the past, and local operator Ecotur has adopted this method as a way of discovering more about wolves, offering evening treks to hear the howl of the wolf.\n\n## Horse riding and donkey trekking\n\nExploring the park's pristine wilderness on horseback or taking it slowly by donkey feels like a link to the past as well as a way to cover a lot of ground while enjoying the unmotorised peace.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park is two-thirds forest, mostly beech, with other foliage including black pine and silver birch. Species such as the chamois, the Marsican brown bear and the Apennine wolf roam the inhospitableseeming landscape. The densely forested hills hide wild boar, and roe and red deer, while smaller mammals include martens, otters, badgers and polecats. You're most likely to see squirrels, dormice, hedgehogs, moles, weasels, hares and foxes.

Start your exploration from the headquarters of the national park, the town of Pescasseroli, which lies in the upper valley of the Sangro River, backed by thickly wooded hills.\n\nAfter parking your car in the car park, try one of the short trails cobwebbing out in all directions (maps are available from the town). You'll soon be immersed in the peace, birdsong and sumptuous natural splendour of the national park, with towering peaks plummeting down into forested valleys.\n\nAfter your walk is done, hop back in the car for the 7km drive to Opi, a medieval town perched on a rocky promontory with views over the surrounding thickly wooded countryside, and eat a meal featuring local mountain produce, comprising ingredients such as lamb, truffles and wild mushrooms, at one of the local restaurants, or\n\n## Four days\n\nFor this slower route around Abruzzo National Park, once again start at the small town of Pescasseroli, where you can consult the local visitor centre to help decide which of the park's 150 walking trails you fancy, or arrange wolf- or bear-spotting excursions. Next, head on to Opi. From this town you can take a 2½-hour walk through Valle di Fondillo, past thickly wooded areas alive with wildlife - there's a chance you'll see chamois, and possibly bears (they're shy, but keep quiet, calm and at unwrap a picnic lakeside at your next destination.\n\nFinish your day trip at Barrea, 13km further on, a magical-looking red-roofed town that clings to the steep, wooded lakeside. The deep blue waters of vast Lake Barrea appear to have been here for millennia, but the lake was created by damming the river after WWII.\n\nThere are lake beaches or you can hire boats so that you can complete your day gliding across the water, walls of mountains on every side.\n\na distance). You could also climb Monte Amaro (Bitter Mountain; 2793m), one of the highest Apennine peaks (it lies just outside the park, in Maiella National Park), for heart-in-mouth, moonscape views. At your third stop, make a base in Civitella Alfedena, a higgledy-piggledy village on a wooded hilltop above Barrea Lake. Choose a walking trail from the town, such as around the Val di Rosa, a forested valley that offers the best chance of spotting the park's graceful herds of chamois. On your final day, take a beautiful journey to Scanno, just outside the protected area, past the Lago di Scanno, a rippling mirror of bluegreen lake. The road from the lake runs through the Gole di Sagittario, a chasm hemmed in by vast walls of rock, and snakes above the turquoise waters of the Sagittario river. If the villages clinging almost surreally to the hillsides remind you of works by Dutch artist MC Escher, you're on to something: he drew the town of Castrovalva near here.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-17 -->\n\n## Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park\n\n03 SPAIN\n\nIf you imagined the Pyrenees as piercing peaks and crystalline lakes of singular beauty, you were probably thinking of Spain's Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici.\n\nigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici' may sound more like a Catalan riddle than a national park, but few labels are quite so apt, describing as it does this splendid world of winding streams (aigüestortes) and lakes (estany). The Pyrenees are home to an estimated 1000 lakes, and 300 of these fall within the park's boundaries. So expansive are these bodies of water - which owe their presence to the impenetrable granite substrata that serve as foundations for the peaks - that, remarkably, 15 percent of the park's surface area is water. ' A\n\nEvidence of human settlement here dates back more than 8000 years, but this is a place where nature holds sway, where the human story is a mere footnote to altogether more compelling tales from the natural world.\n\nSculpted and forged by glaciers over two million years, the park is essentially two U-shaped, east-west valleys that begin at an altitude of 1600m and don't stop climbing until they approach a dizzying 3km high. Against a backdrop of jagged granite shards, transparent mountain waters, forests of pine and fir, and high pastures carpeted with spring wildflowers, are found natural features stranger than fiction: free-roaming horses that wear cow bells, a century-old bonsai pine tree growing straight from a rock, fields of wild saffron, places with mythic names like Agujas Perdut (Lost Peaks) and Estany Perdut (Lost Lake), mountains where Atlantic and Mediterranean weather systems collide… and such is the drama of the park's topography and the accessibility of its inner reaches and hiking trails that it has been described as Yellowstone, Canada and the Alps all squeezed into one 'miniature' package.\n\nToolbox When to go Most of the high valleys and certainly the hiking trails remain inaccessible for much of the year, making the park primarily a summer experience. May and June are the best months, because the streams fill with water at this time, while flowers bloom from June until late July.\n\nGetting there The park lies in the Pyrenees in the northwestern Spanish region of Catalonia, close to the border with Aragón, and north of Lérida. It's about a day's drive from Barcelona.\n\nPark in numbers 141.2 Area covered (sq km)\n\n3033\n\nHighest point: Pic de Comolaforno (m)\n\nNumber of lakes (estanys) within park\n\n300 boundaries\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-18 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nPensión Santa Maria I n the mountain village of Taüll, this lovely place looks out over the town's fabled Romanesque churches and sweeping prePyrenean valleys.

The rooms are tastefully furnished and the building oozes timeless character. Owner Alex is warm, welcoming and a fount of information on the area.\n\n## Alberg Taüll\n\nThis is everything a hostel should be: the stylish rooms feature large beds with orthopaedic mattresses, there's underfloor heating for those crisp mountain mornings and you'll find a large map of the park in the common area to help you plan your hikes.\n\n## Roca Blanca\n\nThis small hotel in\n\nEspot has contemporary art on the walls, caring personal service and lovely rooms with plenty of space. Some have balconies, and there's a gym, sauna and a relaxing garden space.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Hiking\n\nThere's no better way to explore the park than by hiking the trails that connect one mountain with the next, pausing to explore the deep valleys and gin-clear lakes as you go. Crossing the park in a single day is possible, but most walkers restrict themselves to one or two of the main valleys - Llong and Llobreta - thereby gaining a much more intimate picture of the park. Remember that the weather can be fickle and that snow is possible up high on any day of the year.\n\n## Tracking down trees\n\nClose to the Estany Llong, perhaps the loveliest of the high Pyrenean valleys, you can find a famous dwarf pine thrusting out of a rock; there's also a 600-year-old black pine with a girth of 6m that predates Columbus.\n\nExploring villages Just outside the southwestern entry to the park, the Vall de Boí hosts Unesco-listed Romanesque churches small, unadorned stone structures that were constructed between the 11th and 14th centuries.\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 East-west traverse You can walk right across the park in one day.

Birds of prey are something of a park speciality, with the golden eagle, griffon vulture and lammergeier the standouts. Other important birds you may see include the turkey-like capercaillie, rock ptarmigan and black woodpecker. At lower altitudes, deciduous forests (such as oak and ash) and open grasslands dominate, but these yield to mountain pine, rhododendron and silver fir.\n\n#\n\nپہ‎\n\nSTOAT The stoat (shorttailed weasel) may look cute, but it's capable of killing mammals and rodents 10 times its size.

The views as you cross between east and west are some of the most spectacular anywhere in Spain and possibly even Europe. But you don't have to go to such lengths to enjoy the park's best scenery and you'll be amply rewarded if you spend your day exploring Llong and Llobreta, the two main valleys in the west. Llong in particular captures the essence of the park's appeal: lammergeiers soar above on the thermals and\n\n## Two days\n\nAfter the exertions of day one, sit back and enjoy a drive. Base yourself at Taüll and spend the morning exploring the Vall de Boí and its unforgettable Romanesque churches. Follow the valley's southwestern descent along the L500, then veer south on the N230 and east on the N260. As you shadow the park's southern boundary, the hamlets of Perves and Peramea look for all the world like Tuscan hill towns.\n\nDetour north up the L503 to Cabdella, which is the valley's bowl - at once vast and intimate - feels like a natural amphitheatre.\n\nClimb the moraine off the lake's northeastern tip and watch for the fortress-like outcrops of Agujas Perdut away to the southeast. It's here that you'll find the iconic 600-year-old black pine; the equally celebrated dwarf pine is trackside en route back to Estany de Llobreta. Llobreta is fed by the Cascada de Sant Esperit waterfall and its shoreline turns autumnal yellow in September.\n\nsurrounded by mountains. Back on the N260, the road turns north, with a detour into the park along the LV5004 from Espot, then climbs, following switchback upon hairpin bend all the way to the Puerto de la Bonaigua. Further on, the Vall d'Aran is a pretty ski centre, while the final southward sweep offers magnificent views of the park's Besiberri Massif, which includes the Pic de Comolaforno, the park's highest peak, on your left as you return to the Vall de Boí.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-21 -->\n\nParco Nazionale dell' Arcipelago di La Maddalena\n\n04 I TALY\n\nA pink-granite wonderland fringed by seas of kaleidoscopic blue, this Italian archipelago between Corsica and Sardinia begs to be dived, strolled and swooned over.\n\nY our boat bobs below weatherbeaten licks of pink granite in the Bocche di Bonifacio, the strait that draws a rich ribbon of blue between Sardinia and Corsica. As the sun beams down, you're grateful for the northwesterly maestrale (breezes), which have sculpted La Maddalena archipelago's rocks over millennia. Rounding a headland, you spy an island necklaced with white-sand coves and plumed with dark pines. Just as you think it couldn't get more ravishing, a pod of dolphins appears on cue, frolicking breathtakingly close in water fading from azure to deepest sapphire.\n\nSuch enthralling moments are the norm in this vast marine park, sprinkled with 62 islands and islets dropped like stepping stones between the northeastern coast of Sardinia and Corsica. The seven main islands are the heights of a valley that now lies submerged - an Atlantis of sorts. But La\n\nMaddalena's isles predate such myths. They rose up in the late Paleozoic era, some 300 million years ago, when the continents of Euramerica and Gondwana collided to form the supercontinent of Pangaea. Surprising, then, that aside from the odd inquisitive Roman, the islands lay deserted until the mid-17th century, when a few shepherds from Corsica arrived on La Maddalena.\n\nVisit today and you can't help but think that that old warhorse Giuseppe Garibaldi was on to something when he snapped up the entire island of Caprera in the mid-19th century and called it his 'Eden'. Indeed, whether you dive in barracuda-filled waters, wander through holm oak and juniper that hum with cicada song, or drop anchor at a cove discreetly tucked amid ragged granite cliffs, you'll be inclined to agree that this national park is a little slice of heaven.\n\n↓  The turquoise bay of Cala Coticcio on the island of Caprera is just one of many perfect places to swim.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The season runs from Easter to October. Spring and autumn are best for dolphin, whale and bird watching (this is an important trans-Saharan migration stopover). Temperatures soar and room rates skyrocket in July and August.\n\n## Getting there\n\nThe nearest airport is in Olbia, a 45-minute drive south of Palau.

Bottlenose dolphins and fin whales glide through the sea, while Audouin's gulls and peregrine falcons swoop overhead.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nIsland hop to pink-granite isles, swim in translucent waters and feel the revolutionary spirit at Garibaldi's residence.\n\n## Three days\n\nBuongiorno! An espresso shot and you're off on the ferry from Palau, slicing through topaz waters to pink-granite La Maddalena. Get acquainted with the main island, hanging out in its harbourside cafes and cobbled piazzas. Or hire wheels to zip around the 20km panoramic road that loops the island. Pause to swim in crystal-clear bays like Giardinelli, Monti della Rena and Cala Spalmatore. Cap off the day with superfresh seafood at Il Ghiottone.\n\nOn day two, cross the causeway to the rocky, pine-brushed isle of Caprera, where you can strike out on walking trails: hike to 212m Tejalone for broad views and to spot hovering falcons. Devote an hour to touring the former residence of Giuseppe Garibaldi, professional revolutionary and all-round Italian hero. Tie this in with a refreshing paddle in aquamarine water at temptingly nearby coves like Cala Coticcio. On your third day, either boat it out to neighbouring islands or dive deep in the marine park.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-23 -->\n\n## Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park\n\n05 SPAIN\n\nThe three islands of Illas Cíes dominate northwestern Spain's Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park with wild coastal scenery, prolific birdlife and glorious beaches.\n\nf it weren't for Galicia's rather unpredictable weather, the Costa del Sol might never have happened. Instead, beachgoers would have flown into Vigo and colonised en masse the Illas Cíes, the heart and soul of the Parque Nacional de las Islas Atlánticas de Galicia. If you happen upon these islands on a sunny day and the Atlantic winds drop, you'll find yourself wondering why this place isn't crawling with visitors. Then, in the amount of time it takes to lay your towel upon an empty stretch of sand or raise your binoculars to identify one of the islands' seabirds, you'll be giving thanks for the squally winds and scudding clouds that are surely not far away and that have preserved the Illas Cíes in a state of protected near-perfection. I\n\nHuman habitation on the islands has ebbed and flowed down through the centuries. Monastic orders and pirates made the islands their own in medieval times. Although the islands' human history is a story of retreat and separation from the rest of Spain, these islands are semi-submerged mountain peaks from the same range that rises above the Galician coast, marooned at sea a mere two million years ago when the land east of here subsided and sea levels rose.\n\nAlthough the national park encompasses four archipelagos - Cíes, Ons, Sálvora and Cortegada - it is Cíes that most appeals. Its three islands - Monteagudo (Sharp Mount) in the north, Do Faro (Lighthouse Island) in the middle and San Martiño (St Martin) to the south - are dramatic granite upthrusts from the sea. Wild Atlantic winds buffet vertical cliffs along the islands' western coasts - cliffs that shelter the world's largest colony of seagulls - leaving the east coast to those splendid beaches that may just amount to Europe's best-kept secret.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-24 -->\n\n## Toolbox\n\n## When to go\n\nPublic boats to Cíes normally only sail during Semana Santa (Holy Week), on weekends and holidays in May, daily from June to late September, and on the first two weekends of October. Winter here, when boats can usually be found on an ad hoc basis, has its own wild-andwindswept charm.\n\n## Getting there\n\nAtlantic Islands of Galicia National Park lies off Spain's far northwestern coast and is accessible from Vigo, Sanxenxo and Portonovo.\n\n## Park in numbers\n\n84.8\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n197\n\nHighest point: Alto das Cíes on Monteagudo (m)\n\n22,000\n\nNumber of seagull pairs on Cíes archipelago\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Gran Hotel Nagari\n\n## Boutique &amp; Spa\n\nVigo is the most rewarding base for visiting the Cíes islands, and the city's compact old town and lively eating scene make it an attractive counterpoint to the wilds of the islands.

The 39 all-sea-view rooms are bright and pretty, and there's a fine restaurant. There's a five-night minimum stay from mid-July to the end of August.\n\nseagulls may get all the headlines by sheer weight of numbers, but birds of prey, petrels, pelicans and elusive Iberian guillemots are also present, with migratory species pausing here en route to/from Africa.\n\n## Walking\n\nWalking trails skirt the shores of the Cíes islands and the Illa de Ons. One particular favourite is the climb up to the high lookout along the Ruta Monte Faro. With no climb rising 200m above sea level, hiking here is usually far more spectacular than taxing.\n\n↓ The remarkable Monte Faro on Do Faro (Lighthouse Island), Illas Cíes.\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Ruta Monte Faro The popular, 7km-return Ruta Monte Faro is a gentle climb, save for the last push to the lighthouse, which entails a series of steepish switchbacks.\n\n## 02 Ruta de Monteagudo\n\nThis is a gentle 5km-return stroll along the spine of Monteagudo, following the contours of the island's interior to ensure no steep ascents and passing through forests along the way.\n\n## 03 Ruta del Alto del Príncipe\n\nBeginning by the sands of Praia dos Rodas, this 3km walk crosses Monteagudo island, allowing you to see the transition from quiet lagoon to Atlantic hinterland.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-25 -->\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n๕\n\n## What to spot...\n\nBirdlife dominates these islands, whose otherwise inaccessible cliffs provide safe nesting sites for all manner of seabirds.

From Sanxenxo a couple of ferry operators do the 45-minute run out to the Illa de Ons several times daily from July to mid-September. The island is 5.6km long, with sandy beaches, cliffs, traces of ruined settlements, rich birdlife, and walking trails that ensure you see most of the island in a day catch the ferry back to Vigo before the sun sets.\n\nUnless you want to miss the best the islands have to offer, don't forget to pack your binoculars (for birdwatching, especially on the western side, around the turnaround point of both hikes) and your swimming costume. If you forget the latter, one cove north of Praia dos Rodas is the Praia das Figueiras, which is clothing optional.\n\nwithout even breaking a sweat. The island brings to mind an outpost of Scotland, with moorland grasses and vegetation beaten into submission by relentless winds. If you're lucky enough to be here in September you might even have some corners to yourself - the beaches here rival those on the Cíes islands, so bring your swimmers. If you'd like to experience the silence (if you ignore the wind!) that reigns after the day-trippers go home, consider staying overnight - or for a lifetime.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-27 -->\n\nGetty Images | Gabriele Rodriquez Photographer\n\nI TALY\n\nParco Nazionale delle Dolomiti Bellunesi\n\n06\n\nSkirted by pea-green valleys, Italy's lesser-known Dolomites are a humbling, heart-soaring vision.

The scenic drama has been formed through the different consistency and brittleness of the rock, which has allowed erosion to sculpt it into jagged shapes, and hollow out deep, wide valleys and corridor-narrow gorges.\n\nBefore the last ice age, 250 million years ago, this area was part of a prehistoric coral reef in the primordial ocean, Tethys. As the sea disappeared, the rocks beneath rose to form the range and are consequently rich in prehistoric fossils. The Dolomites were named after 19th-century geologist Déodat de Dolomieu, who was first to analyse the rocks.\n\nNeanderthals hunted huge mammals in this zone over 40,000 years ago, while Homo sapiens arrived 10 millennia later to mine flint. The first villages began to take root around 6000 BC. Later Romans, Byzantines, Lombards, Franks and Venetians all staked their claim here. In the 18th and 19th centuries the area passed from French to Austrian hands, eventually becoming part of the kingdom of the House of Savoy. However, the most recent tumultuous period of history was WWI, when the Dolomites became an unimaginably challenging battleground between Austria-Hungary and Italy. Its castle-like turrets and gully defences made\n\nthe mountains a natural, harsh fortress. Monuments to the dead and traces of many military routes remain - the famous vie ferrate (iron roads) consisting of metal tracks and lines across the rocks are still climbable and walkable today.\n\n- ↓ A walker pauses beneath mighty Monte Pelmo (3168m).

The park offers some challenging, breathtaking climbs, including five via ferrata routes that originated to aid military advances across these inhospitable borderlands during WWI. These metal cables fixed into the rock allow mere mortals access to some of the most dazzling peaks, but you'll need climbing experience and a head for heights.\n\nanother glorious place just outside the park gateway of Feltre. It's full of character, charm and antiques, and surrounded by carefully tended gardens with lawns and flowers.\n\n## B&amp;B Villa Rosa\n\nA dark-red and white Venetian villa set in lovely deepgreen countryside, this has magnificent views and a choice of apartments or B&amp;B rooms. There's a cosy family atmosphere and simple, charming rooms with wooden furnishings and take-your-breathaway mountain panoramas.\n\n## Botanical treasure-hunting\n\nRenowned botanically since the 17th century, the area remains famous for its rare flora. Remote grass-cloaked hills and valleys are speckled by the delicate beauty of flowers such as the black-vanilla orchid, the alpine snowdrop and the violet, star-shaped Campanula morettiana , the symbol of the park.\n\n## Horse riding and donkey trekking\n\nExplore this pristine wilderness on horseback or more slowly with donkeys. Wending along narrow pathways is one of the most peaceful ways to travel through the park, with the sense of travelling here as others have for centuries.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park could make a botanist weep with the abundance of rarities. High-altitude blooms include varieties of lily, crucifera, orchid and primrose. Forests knit across the landscape, including beech, conifers, pine, oak and silver fir. Chamois flit through the trees, sharing the territory with mouflon, roe deer, hares, foxes, badgers, ermines, weasels, martens, marmots, squirrels, hedgehogs and the rare Eurasian lynx. Golden eagles and rock partridges are among 115 species of bird that whir overhead or shelter in the undergrowth.\n\nGOLDEN EAGLE There are eight pairs of golden eagles in the park. This mightiest of birds, with a magnificent wingspan of around 2m, covers huge areas of territory, circling slowly high in the sky tracking its prey.\n\nMARMOT Inconceivably ancient in origin (fossil evidence demonstrates they were in Europe around 600,000 years ago), these small, furry burrowing creatures with chisel-like teeth were hunted to extinction here but were reintroduced in 2007.\n\nEURASIAN LYNX Long a stranger to the area, the lynx is back: tracks have been discovered in one of the most inaccessible areas, the Monti del Sole mountains, only a few kilometres from Belluno.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-31 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Cadini del Brentòn This 1km walk in Valle del Mis takes you past 15 translucent pools carved out by a series of small waterfalls.\n\n## 02 Trail 803\n\nThis trail wends through the botanically fascinating valleys of San Martino and Fratta and takes around 7½ hours, starting at the village of Vignui (533m).\n\n03 Alta Via 1 One of six high-altitude trails across the Dolomites, this begins at Lago di Braies in Val Pusteria to the north and ends in Belluno; it takes 13 days, covering 150km.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-32 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nEnjoy some alpine Venetian splendour, sample high-altitude trails, enjoy adrenaline-pumping sports, and get set up for it all with some (delicious) fried cheese.\n\n↓ The imposing walls of La Croda del Becco reflected in the serene waters of Lago di Braies. ↓ The cliffs of Monte Pelmo loom over a herd of horses.\n\nfrom easy trails to becauseit's-there mountaineering, exploring areas such as the ravines and furrows of the Valle dell'Ardo. Alta Via (high-altitude trail) 1, one of eight such trails across the range, ends at Belluno. You're also well placed to fortify yourself with some particularly sumptuous cheeses, including Schiz (semi-soft cow's-milk cheese, usually fried in butter) and yolk-yellow Malga Bellunese.\n\nAfter spending a couple of days exploring the countryside from Belluno,\n\n## Four days\n\nStart your exploration in the major gateway to the national park, the graceful Venetian town of Belluno. It's a harmonious sprawl of red-roofed pastel palazzi dominated by a soaring and elegant cathedral spire and dwarfed by the thrilling, magnificent, silver-grey Dolomites. Once an important trading post on the way north and a favoured summer bolthole, it makes an ideal base for the park, and from here you can explore walking trails northwest into the shimmering mountains,\n\n## A week\n\nThis circular driving route takes you through thrilling green-and-grey natural splendour - visual soul food. It cuts through the centre of the park, where the route passes through inky-green woodlands and green-cloaked hills and valleys, drawing your eyes up to the folds and summits of the pale mountains above.\n\nStart the trip in Belluno, the Christmas card-pretty Venetian alpine town, then take the road around 20km northwest to Agordo.\n\nThis mountain base is the take a short trip to explore from the other major base for the park, the town of Feltre, 20km southwest of Belluno. Feltre predates the Romans and was mentioned by Pliny. It lies on the Stizzon River and has a fine Renaissance historic centre. From here you can discover the secluded, open valleys of Lamen and San Martino - look for the small potholes eroded by the Colmeda stream - with the crowning Vette Feltrine forming a magnificent backdrop leading up to Monte Pavione (2334m).\n\nstarting point for many trails into forgottenfeeling valleys such as the Canali, Gares or San Lucano, from where you can take a breathtaking yet easygoing walk to the Cascate dell'Inferno waterfalls.\n\nNext you can move on to the beautiful lakeside town of Alleghe, where pointed rooftops are backed by thick forest and pale peaks, all reflected in the green-blue waters of the lake - popular for boating in summer and skating in winter. This is a popular ski town too, with runs across the surrounding hills.\n\nThe journey continues 10km further to Selva di Cadore, a mountain village huddled around its rocket-like church steeple, with the silver and grey bulk of Monte Pelmo (3168m) looming nearby. Your final halt is at pointed-roofed Forno di Zoldo, a 20-minute drive away, which also makes for another good ski base in season. From here you can take the road back down to Belluno.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-33 -->\n\nBerchtesgaden National Park\n\nBe floored by mountains of myth, fjord-like lakes and lookout eyries in Germany's Bavarian hiking heartland, where views send spirits soaring like the region's golden eagles.\n\nany millennia ago, lore has it, King Watzmann ruled Berchtesgaden with an iron fist, striking fear into farmers by chaining them to their ploughs like lowly oxen. But the king got his comeuppance and was turned to stone for his evil deeds. He now reigns over Berchtesgaden as Watzmann mountain (2713m), terrifying only those who dare climb his notorious Ostwand (East Face). Some say it is a fate too good for such a tyrant, surveying, as he does, a canvas of glacierencrusted peaks, torrents and wild forests bejewelled with lakes from his rocky throne. M\n\nIndeed there is something almost regal about Berchtesgaden National Park, with its procession of mountains just shy of 3000m, which wear pearly crowns of snow in winter. Here nature pulls out all the stops, with bigshouldered peaks muscling in among rugged gorges and wild-flower-freckled pastures that recall the opening credits of The Sound of Music - no coincidence, incidentally, as they were filmed in this neck of the woods.\n\nWedged into Bavaria's southeastern crook, where the Northern Limestone Alps ripple across to Austria, the park was founded in 1978, but its origins stretch back aeons. Its phalanx of peaks was created by tectonic uplift some 770 million years ago and has been shaped by glacial erosion ever since.\n\nWax lyrical we might, but it isn't until you explore on foot the park's wilderness that you see what all the fuss is about. Nothing can convey what it feels like to witness dawn from an alpine hut as the first sunlight creeps over the mountains, or the exhilaration of reaching a summit as sunset pinkens the sky and ibex come out to graze. ' Der Berg ruft ' -the mountain calls, say the Bavarians. And never more so than here.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Summer is hiking prime time, with snow-free trails, mild weather (bar the odd thunderstorm) and Alpine huts open. Hikes at lower elevations are doable in late spring, when the pastures are cloaked with wild flowers. In autumn, forests kindle into colour and game features on inn menus.\n\nGetting there The park nuzzles the Austrian border 26km south of Salzburg, where the nearest airport is located. A great base is Berchtesgaden, which has a decent publictransport network.\n\nPark in numbers 210 Area covered (sq km)\n\n2713\n\n(m) Highest peak: Watzmann (Germany's second highest)\n\n1990 Year the park became a biosphere reserve\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-34 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nWatzmannhaus These rustic Alpine digs sit bang in the heart of the national park at 1930m. A bolthole for mountaineers since 1888, the lodge creaks with history and perches precariously on a rocky outcrop, commanding 360-degree views. Accommodation consists of no-frills dorms, and dinners are simple but hearty. This is the ideal jumping-off point for hikes - the four-day Watzmanntour included and ascents of Watzmann itself.

Spring brings a profusion of wild flowers, such as gentians, pulsatilla, cyclamens, edelweiss, buttercups, orchids and Alpine rhododendrons. Species to watch out for include ibex, chamois, red deer, marmots, blue hares and capercaillies. Golden eagles, hawks, woodpeckers and warblers can often be sighted flying overhead.\n\n/\n\n## GENTIAN\n\nThese deep-purplish-blue, trumpet-shaped flowers herald summer on the park's mountain slopes.

It's a tad touristy, sure, but you can't help those goosebumps when the captain plays his horn to the echo wall. Tack on a short hike from the onion-domed chapel of St Bartholomä to the Eiskapelle (Ice Chapel), the lowest-lying permanent snowfield in the Alps. Cap the day off with a meal made with locally sourced ingredients, and a cold foamy one in the beer garden\n\n## Four days\n\nIf you're fit and up for a challenge, devote the entire four days to the hut-to-hut Watzmanntour, penetrating the furthest reaches of the Berchtesgaden Alps. Otherwise, follow the two-day itinerary, then on the third day factor in a breather in Berchtesgaden. You could, for instance, head to Salzbergwerk. Once a major producer of 'white gold', the town's salt mines now offer 90-minute tours, where you whoosh down a wooden slide to a grotto and subterranean lake. Or ease trek-tired feet at the at Gaststätte St Bartholomä. On day two, begin, say, with a hike to Jenner's 1874m summit for views of the Alps rolling into neighbouring Austria. In the afternoon, take the shuttle up the windy road to the Eagle's Nest, Hitler's impossibly perched Alpine HQ.

Dinner is in the best of Bavarian traditions, with pork roast, lashings of dumplings and Weizen (wheat beer) at the vaulted Bräustübl beer hall.\n\nOn day four, walk into the mist-laced Wimbach Gorge, where a river rages past sheer limestone walls. Go for a dip or paddle in the gem-hued Hintersee. Linger over lake fish grilled simply on the terrace at Pension Seeklause as the last sunlight creeps over the water and mountains.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-37 -->\n\nGERMANY\n\n## Black Forest National Park\n\n08\n\nWith glacier-carved valleys and dark spruce forests cloaking hills that seem to ripple to infinity, Germany's newest national park is every inch the Grimm fairy tale.\n\nM orning lifts a misty veil on a forest of pine, spruce and beech as sun rays rake through the treetops to spotlight a red squirrel scampering high in the branches, velvety purple foxgloves and ferns uncoiling lazily, their fronds stretching to reach the light. The only sound at this hour is the tentative hammering of a woodpecker, the distant gurgle of a clear mountain stream and your feet falling rhythmically on rock as you stride through this forest of myth. In this lonely neck of the woods, as the forest shakes off its dewy slumber, the trail is yours alone.\n\nFew forests have been as eulogised and romanticised as the Schwarzwald, so named because when the Romans first came here, they found a dark, murky, nearimpenetrable Silva Nigra (Black Forest). Fast-forward 2000 years and the region still feels immune to time and trends. Mountains pucker above vast tracts of forest and the gentle pleats and folds of valleys. Heatherflecked moorland dips down to the icy blue-green glint of glacial lakes, and wood shingle-tiled farmhouses crouch low beside swift-flowing brooks.\n\nTiptoe away from the villages and you'll find pockets of pure wilderness, the finest of which are showcased in the Black Forest National Park, established in 2014. It sits astride the main crest of the Northern Black Forest, between the Murgtal valley and the Black Forest High Rd (B500), a ribbon stitching together the park's corset of mountains, valleys, high moors and cirque lakes. There is something poetic about the way the park unfolds around you as you strike out into its remotest reaches, where silence blankets the woods and the scenery is the stuff of bedtime stories.\n\n↓ The Black Forest's famously verdant flora surrounds a footbridge over the Neckar river.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The park never feels overcrowded. Go in summer for sap-scented strolls and lake swims, in winter for Christmas-card scenery and cross-country skiing. Late spring brings wild flowers, autumn the delights of fungi foraging, gold-tinged beech forests and stag rutting.\n\nGetting there The park sits in the Northern Black Forest in southwestern Germany, alongside the French border. The nearest airport is Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, 41km north.

It's a mystical landscape where prehistoric chieftains were buried on lonely hilltops and heavy stones were dragged to create stone circles that are thought to have played a part in complex pagan rituals.\n\nThe allure of the hills is undeniable and for eight millennia humans have shaped the land and the culture here, with standing stones, Neolithic tombs and Iron Age hill forts littering the slopes. Early Christian chapels lie in remote valleys, and Norman castles, such as magnificent Carreg Cennen, perch on limestone crags, mighty symbols of medieval power, wealth and territorial struggle.\n\nIt was the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century that brought the greatest change to the area, however, with quarries and mines opening up across the landscape and the building of canals and rail lines to transport limestone, coal and iron through the wilds.\n\nThe hills are formed from ancient red sandstone, cleaved by gushing rivers that cut through the soft rock and carved the park into four distinct sections. The most remote is the wild and desolate Black Mountain region to the west, with its high moors and glacial lakes. To the south, outcrops of carboniferous limestone have been sculpted by water to form deep, wooded gorges dotted with waterfalls, caves and sinkholes, while the lowlands are a pastoral idyll of rolling green fields and lacy hedgerows.\n\nThis magnificent natural setting has become an outdoor playground for all, with elite units of the British Army training in the most wild and remote hills, mountain bikers\n\nwhizzing down steep slopes and parents of young children inspiring a love of the great outdoors on manageable walks that offer spectacular views from dramatic peaks.\n\n↓ The summit cairn of Pen-y-Fan (886m), south Wales' highest peak.

With the Milky Way laid before you and ancient ruins framing the view, 11th-century Llanthony Priory is an atmospheric spot to contemplate your place in the universe.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park encompasses a diverse range of habitats, from exposed upland moors, dry heathland and glacial lakes to sheltered wooded valleys and slow-moving rivers and canals. This diversity provides for an array of flora and fauna, including some endemic species such as native varieties of whitebeam and hawkweed. In the birdliferich park, you may spot kestrels, red kites and reed warblers, and large numbers of winter migrants on Llangorse Lake and Talybont Reservoir. Otters and water voles are found along the waterways.\n\nGREAT CRESTED NEWT This protected species can be seen in ponds from late February to early June. They are dark brown with a bright orange underside and the males have a distinctive jagged crest.\n\nMARSH FRITILLARY BUTTERFLY In serious decline, this brightly coloured butterfly with orange-and-blackchecked wings can be found in damp tussocky grassland, especially around Penderyn in the south of the park.\n\n## BADGER\n\nA fat body, short legs and distinctive black-and-whitestriped head make the badger instantly recognisable, but its nocturnal behaviour and underground setts make it difficult to spot.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-42 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Beacons Horseshoe The park's most famous hike, this challenging 17km ridge walk takes in three summits, including Pen-yFan, and offers spectacular views and Bronze Age cairns en route.\n\n## 02 Sugar Loaf\n\nAn easy ascent rewarded with stunning views, this is a great 6.5km family hike through oak woodland and open moorland, with only the final section a challenge for little legs.\n\n## 03 Four Falls\n\nA magical route following rivers that plunge through wooded gorges and disappear into caves, this 6km walk takes in four waterfalls, including impressive Sgwd yr Eira.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-43 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nHike along high ridges with sweeping views, discover ancient ruins in empty valleys, walk behind waterfalls and explore the depths of the Earth in this magnificently diverse park.\n\n↓ Walkers on the summit of Corn Du make their way to the summit of Pen-y-Fan. ↓ It's only a short walk to visit the Sgwd Gwladus (Lady's Falls) on the Afon Pyrddin river.\n\n## Two days\n\nIf you've only got the weekend here you'll get the best overview of the park by combining a scenic drive with some time on foot in the hills.\n\nStart your trip in handsome Hay-on-Wye with a quick browse around the bookshops, then hop in the car and head south onto the deserted moorland of Gospel Pass for epic views of the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons. Heading down into the Vale of Ewyas, the landscape gradually becomes greener, and the 12th-century priory ruins and 6th-century St David's Church at Llanthony make an atmospheric stop. Continue south and stop off for a drink at the oldest pub in Wales, the Skirrid Mountain Inn in Llanfihangel Crucorney.\n\nThen pop in to see the priory church in Abergavenny before heading to picturesque Crickhowell and on to Nantyffin Cider Mill for lunch around the cider press.\n\nContinuing north, you'll reach Tretower, with its sturdy Norman tower and 15th-century manor house\n\n## A week\n\nWith a week to explore you can discover the back roads and remote ruins of the park, search out its best waterfalls and caves, and find a window in the weather for some serious hiking. Once you've bagged Pen-y-Fan and driven Gospel Pass it's worth spending a day around Georgian Brecon, exploring the cathedral and castle in the morning before hiring a bike for a trip along the canal to Talybont Reservoir or hitting the Mynydd Illtud mountain-biking trail. With a base in Llandovery or with medieval garden, from where it's an easy drive back to Hay.\n\nOn your second day head for south Wales' highest peak, Pen-y-Fan. You've got a choice of routes to the top, but if you're reasonably fit and the weather holds, an all-day hike up the north side of the mountain is the most rewarding. With few hikers and superb views, the Horseshoe Ridge walk from the Lower Neuadd Reservoir is one of the region's finest; but remember to pack a waterproof jacket.\n\nLlandeilo, you could spend a day exploring the wild and remote west of the park, visiting impressive cliff-top Carreg Cennen (a medieval castle) and the Red Kite Feeding Station, and taking the tranquil hike up to glorious Llyn y Fan Fach.\n\nExplore Fforest Fawr Geopark with a trip to the National Showcaves, followed by the Four Falls or Henrhyd Falls walks to see the area's gushing waterfalls, possibly topped off with a visit to Penderyn Distillery.\n\nIt's also worth spending a day at 4000-year-old Garn Goch hill fort for panoramic views and then walking around Usk Reservoir to Glasfynydd Forest and on to the upper moorland for superb views of Carmarthen Fans, Bannau Sir Gaer and Fan Brycheiniog. On your final day, get out on the water for a gentle paddle along the Wye or the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, or experienced kayakers could tackle the white water of the Tawe or Sawdde Rivers.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-44 -->\n\nCairngorms National Park\n\nWith a landscape forged from granite and ice, the UK's largest national park is one of the wildest places in Europe outside Norway.\n\n500px | Neil Wakeling\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-45 -->\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-46 -->\n\nt's mid-July, but despite the sunshine it's cold - very cold. A vast expanse of frost-shattered boulders stretches into the distance, sun glinting off the pink-granite crystals and sparkling on patches of snow as you hike across the tundra-like landscape. Nothing stirs except two golden eagles circling high above. But this isn't Arctic Canada or northern Norway. In fact, you're barely 3km from the car park, and you drove here from Glasgow this morning. I\n\nThe Cairngorms is the UK's largest national park (it's twice the size of the Lake District), centred on a 1000m-high mountain plateau with a subarctic climate that encompasses five of Britain's six highest summits. Its dramatic landscapes are the legacy of the last ice age, when glaciers gouged deep valleys through granite bedrock and hollowed out crag-rimmed corries on the hills' northern slopes.\n\nScots pine covered much of the Scottish Highlands as the ice retreated, but a combination of climate change and human felling saw the ancient Caledonian forest reduced to a few small remnants, the most extensive of which survive here in the Cairngorms - Abernethy, Rothiemurchus and Glen Tanar. Rare creatures capercaillies, red squirrels, pine martens, Scottish wildcats - find refuge among trees more than 300 years old.\n\nThe savage conditions on the high plateau mean that it has never seen human habitation, but the lower ground has long been used for sheep farming, forestry and deer stalking. The 1960s saw the development of ski areas at Aviemore, Glenshee and the Lecht, and in 2001 a funicular railway was built almost to the top of Cairn Gorm itself. Controversy ensued,\n\nwith jobs and tourist income pitched against conservation of the natural environment, a debate that continued after the creation of the national park in 2003.\n\n↓ The Cairngorms is among Scotland's best mountain biking destinations. Previous page: Loch an Eilein is one of the park's most beautiful.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go\n\nPeak periods are December to February (ski season) and July to August (school holidays). April to June is ideal for birdlife (nesting ospreys) and scenery (snow patches on the mountains). Autumn is the best time for seeing red deer.\n\n## Getting there\n\nThe Cairngorms lie in the centre of the Scottish Highlands, with Aviemore the main gateway (easily reached by car or train, about three hours from Glasgow or Edinburgh). The nearest airport is Inverness (one hour's drive away).\n\nPark in numbers\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n4528\n\n1309\n\nHighest point: Ben Macdui (m)\n\n278\n\nHighest recorded wind speed in UK: Cairn Gorm summit (km/h)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-47 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Glenmore Campsite\n\nLocated near Aviemore, Glenmore Campsite enjoys one of the finest settings in the national park, with tent, caravan and motorhome pitches spread amid clusters of Scots pines beside a lovely sandy beach on the shores of Loch Morlich. The campsite is the starting point for dozens of superb walks and mountain-bike rides in the surrounding hills and forests, and there is canoeing, dinghy sailing and windsurfing on the loch in summer. The site stays open in winter, when it's popular with snowsports enthusiasts.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Hiking\n\nExploring the high tundra plateaus, pink-granite crags and deep glacial valleys of the Cairngorms is the quintessential park experience. The park contains 43 of Scotland's 282 Munros (mountains over 3000ft high) and offers superb hillwalking, from relatively easy ascents such as Cairn Gorm and Mount Keen to remote and challenging summits like Cairn Toul and Ben Avon. Easier lowlevel hikes lead you through ancient Caledonian pine forests to sparkling, peat-tinted lochans, with the chance of spotting rare wildlife such as capercaillies, crossbills, red squirrels and pine martens.\n\n## The Cross at Kingussie\n\nHoused in a historic weaving mill on the banks of Gynack Burn, The Cross has long had a reputation as the finest restaurant in the Cairngorms. It also offers luxury B&amp;B accommodation in eight cosy bedrooms, one with a balcony overlooking the river.\n\n## Auld Kirk\n\nA converted Victorian church in Ballater provides the setting for this seven-bedroom guest house in the heart of Royal Deeside, where you can enjoy a breakfast prepared using fresh local produce in the light from the Gothic arched windows.\n\n## Snow sports\n\nCairnGorm Mountain is the biggest snow-sports centre in the UK, with more than 30km of marked runs. In clear conditions you can ski or snowboard with a view over pine woods and lochans, while experienced ski-mountaineers can go touring on the high plateau.\n\n## Dog sledding\n\nThe Cairngorm Sleddog Centre is the only place in Britain where you can go dog sledding year-round. Even if there's no snow, you can still hurtle around the forest trails on specially designed wheeled sleds hauled by a team of trained huskies.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe heart of Cairngorms National Park is the high plateau, where the climate is subarctic - snow can fall here even in midsummer. The boulder-strewn landscape supports rare alpine flora and hardy bird species including ptarmigan, snow bunting and dotterel. Heather moorland, famous for its August display of purple flowers, covers 40 percent of the park, while remnants of the post-ice age Caledonian pine forest survive among the foothills and are home to capercaillies, crossbills, pine martens and red squirrels.\n\n## GOLDEN EAGLE\n\nThis iconic Scottish species is one of Europe's largest birds of prey, with a 2m wingspan. They're usually seen soaring overhead as they hunt for ptarmigan and mountain hare.\n\n## SCOTTISH WILDCAT\n\nAn endangered species (fewer than 400 are left in the wild), the wildcat is recognised by its short, bushy tail with black stripes and black tip. See it up close at Newtonmore's Highland Wildlife Park.\n\n## RED DEER\n\nThe largest wild mammal in Britain, red deer roam the hills in herds of up to 50. During the rut (October) males grow impressive antlers and fight for dominance and mating rights.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-48 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Loch an Eilein Wander through pinescented, sun-dappled glades on an easy loop trail around one of the park's prettiest lochs, graced with a ruined island castle.\n\n## 02 Meall a'Bhuachaille\n\nClimb to the 810m summit of this shapely hill above Glenmore for stunning views over Loch Morlich and the rugged northern corries of Cairn Gorm.\n\n## 03 Lairig Ghru\n\nThe park's most challenging low-level walk, this tough 31km hike leads through a wild and intimidating mountain pass strewn with huge granite boulders. For experienced hikers only!\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-49 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nRide a funicular railway and then hike to the savage subarctic summit of Cairn Gorm, or explore the picturesque villages and castles of scenic Royal Deeside.\n\n↓ Ski-touring is a great way to explore beyond the lifts and get out into Cairngorms backcountry. ↓ Now owned by Clan Farquharson, impressive Braemar Castle was originally built in 1628 by John Erskine, the Earl of Mar.\n\n## A day\n\nYou can explore several of the park's highlights during an easy day trip along Ski Rd, between Aviemore and Cairngorm Mountain. Drive to the Cairngorm Reindeer Centre, arriving by 10.45am (daily year-round), to join a 90-minute guided walk over heather-clad hills to feed the UK's only free-ranging herd of reindeer - the animals are really tame and will feed from your hand! Be sure to take walking boots and wrap up warm.\n\nContinue by car to the ski-area car park, where you can ride the Cairngorm\n\nMountain Railway to the top of the hill and join another guided walk (departs 1.30pm May to October, book in advance) to the snow-patched summit of Cairn Gorm (1245m), Britain's sixthhighest mountain (again, you'll need good boots and warm clothes). Your guide will point out rare alpine flowers amid the granite boulders, and you can search for local wildlife such as ptarmigans and mountain hares - if you're lucky, you might spot a golden eagle or two.\n\n## Two days\n\nThe southern approach to the park, along the A93, passes through ever wilder scenery as it follows the route of an 18th-century military road. After you crest the hill at Glenshee Ski Centre the view opens out as you descend towards Braemar. Perched astride Cluny Water, the village merits a stroll before a visit to imposing Braemar Castle (open April to October).\n\nDrive west for 6 miles to the Linn of Dee, where one of Scotland's most famous salmon rivers squeezes\n\nThe views south across a wilderness of bare rock to the rounded summits of Ben Macdui, Beinn a'Bhuird and Ben Avon are well worth the trip.\n\nAfter a late lunch in the Ptarmigan Restaurant - the highest in the UK - return down the mountain and drive back to Loch Morlich for an early-evening stroll (1½ hours on an allabilities trail) or bike ride (45 minutes) around the loch. Keep an eye out for red squirrels among the pine trees and ospreys circling over the loch.\n\nthrough a narrow rocky gorge - there's a lovely woodland walk along the banks. Return to Braemar and motor along the scenic valley of the Dee River eastwards to Balmoral Castle (open April to July), the holiday home of the British royal family. You can explore the formal gardens and visit the stone cottage where Queen Victoria used to write her diary.\n\nOvernight in the picturesque town of Ballater before driving north along the A939, one of the highest, steepest and twistiest roads in the UK, to the pretty Highland village of Tomintoul. Here you can loop north for a few miles to visit the famous Glenlivet distillery (open March to November), where you can fill your own bottle of whisky straight from the cask, or go mountain biking at nearby Bike Glenlivet.\n\nContinue to Aviemore via the minor B970 road and stop off at Loch Garten nature reserve to see the nesting ospreys (April to August).\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-50 -->\n\nUKRAINE\n\n## Carpathian National Nature Park\n\n11\n\nClipping Ukraine's southwest, the Carpathian Mountains are one of Eastern Europe's last true wildernesses, home to the colourful Hutsul people and Ukraine's most diverse fauna and flora.\n\nkraine may be a troubled land these days, but on a hike deep in the Carpathian forest, travelling by country bus in the fading light of a summer evening or surrounded by hearty Hutsuls in a cosy tavern as the snow falls silently outside, you'd never know it. The Carpathians feel a continent away from the post-Soviet badlands of Eastern Ukraine (over 1000km distant), this wedge of subalpine Europe having preserved its upland traditions while now also catering for the needs of modernday visitors. U\n\nThese ancient hills are all about the forest, thick, impenetrable and mysterious, marching up the valley walls in regiments of pine, beech and spruce. Humans have traditionally eked out a living in the long, fertile valleys, their villages stretched along rivers in an elongated jumble of timber dwellings. Above the tree line is the polonyna - the alpine meadows where the Hutsuls herd sheep in summer and produce the creamiest of fresh cheeses in tiny huts. Paying a call on Carpathian shepherds is the essence of any visit to the region.\n\nThe remoteness of the Carpathians is the main reason visitors can still enjoy this pristine swathe of nature. Ukraine's forests were decimated in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it was deemed too expensive to fell trees in the inaccessible Carpathians - so the forests survived. Oddly enough, it was the Soviet authorities who did much to protect the environment here, banning logging and declaring the region a national nature park in 1980.\n\nMost come here to enjoy the great outdoors - hiking, skiing and mountain biking are the most popular activities. However, these valleys also have a human story: the Hutsul people and their multiethnic highland culture are an unmissable feature of this enigmatic mountainscape.\n\n↓ Carpathian National Park protects a swathe of ancient forests, including stands of primeval beech forest.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The park fills with holidaying Ukrainians between June and August and during the winter skiing season (in places). May can still be chilly, but Septembers are mild and bursting with autumnal colour.\n\nGetting there The park lies in Ukraine's southwestern corner, around 160km as the crow flies from the regional capital, Lviv. Trains link Lviv with several Carpathian towns, but services are threadbare. Most locals rely on frequent buses to get around. Driving isn't recommended.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n515 Area covered (sq km)\n\n2061\n\nHighest point: Mount Hoverla (m)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-51 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Mount Hoverla A very popular hike leads to the top of Ukraine's highest peak.

The theme is Oleksa Dovbush, 'the Robin Hood of the Carpathians'.\n\n## 03 Ridge Trail\n\nThis 281km trail leads serious hikers from Rakhiv in the south to Volovets in the north, taking in almost all of the park's highest peaks. Allow 14 days to complete the route.\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## On the Corner Bed &amp; Breakfast\n\nOften celebrated as 'the best place to stay in Ukraine', this family-run guesthouse is a real treat. Mum lays on gourmet-style Ukrainian meals while guests plan their next foray into the Carpathians with assorted relatives. It's in the town of Kolomiya within striking distance of the hills.\n\n## Smerekova Hata\n\nThe pine-fragrant, Hutsul-inspired rooms at this long-established Rakhiv guesthouse have been a hiker favourite since the region opened up in the 1990s. The knowledgeable owner is a local activist who promotes the region's attractions and budding slow-food movement.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Skiing\n\nThe Carpathians are one of Eastern Europe's skiing hot spots, with several slopes dotted around the region. The biggest, best-equipped resort is Bukovel, but for a wilder experience try Slavske, Pylypets or Dragobrat. Cross-country skiing has always been popular and trail marking is improving.\n\n## Experiencing Hutsul culture Ukraine's section of the\n\nCarpathians has traditionally been home to the Hutsuls, a mountain people whose traditions have largely survived. The best place for visitors to get a taste of their idiosyncratic customs is at the Hutsul folk-art museum in Kolomiya.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park is home to deer, squirrels, boars, spotted salamanders and (though they're rarely seen) golden eagles and brown bears. The rivers attract otters, trout, storks and herons.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nThis comprehensive itinerary takes in the best the Carpathian National Nature Park has to offer.\n\n## One week\n\nA week is just enough to see the best of the region, and the following itinerary could be attempted by local bus in that time frame - with a little patience. Start in Kolomiya, just outside the Carpathians, acclimatising and getting acquainted with the local Hutsul culture at the town's superb museum. If you are staying at the On the Corner\n\nCARPATHIAN SQUIRREL Inhabiting the deep subalpine forests and surviving on the abundant supply of nuts and berries that grow there, this red squirrel has distinctively spiked ears, and fur that changes colour to a winter white.\n\nB&amp;B, you'll soon be inspired by your hosts to head for those hills. After two days of exploring it's a short hop to Yaremche, the most touristy of the Carpathian towns but also home to the park headquarters and visitor centre. One of the best places to pick up guides and information, it's also a great base from which to launch flits into the wild. Day four could involve an ascent of Mount Hoverla, Ukraine's highest peak. From there slowly make your way down the valley to Rakhiv, another Hutsul outpost, where there's some great accommodation as well as the chance to explore the southernmost reaches of the Carpathians.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-52 -->\n\nCinque Terre National Park\n\n12 I TALY\n\nIs there a more crazily beautiful landscape than Italy's Cinque Terre National Park? Vertiginous vineyards stripe the sea cliffs, and coastal villages make your heart flip at their Battenbergcake loveliness.\n\nLonely Planet | Justin Foulkes\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-53 -->\n\noppies, blossom, jasmine and violets line the Unesco-listed Cinque Terre's not-for-the-fainthearted coastal path. The stony track skirts the cliffs above a peacock-blue sea, which morphs into a china-blue sky along a soft, melting horizon. Looking up, rows of sinuous-stepped terraces pinstripe the muscular slopes. They look almost tropically lush, sewn together with vines and supported by nearly 7000km of ancient drystone walls, all painstakingly built by hand. Lemons polka-dot coastal orchards. A distant farmer works in the field. Bees buzz and butterflies flutter. P\n\nThe name Cinque Terre (Five Lands) refers to the village areas along the coast, and dates from the 15th century. The cubist-looking medieval villages with their sunset-hued, green-shuttered houses seem to defy gravity, balanced as they are along this heart-rendingly beautiful stretch of Ligurian coast. They were built on steep hillsides as a defence against pirates, and the narrow streets within twist and turn, the better to outsmart invaders. There have been settlements here since ancient times; inhabited since the Bronze Age, this area has been home to Romans, Saracens and local tribes.\n\nThe narrow terraces that stripe the hills have turned the sea cliffs into unlikely agricultural land, producing crisp, dry white wine - sup it for overtones of citrus, green apples and sea air - from ancient vineyards. Work on the terraces and their dividing, supporting drystone walls began around 1000 years ago.\n\nIt was only in the 1970s that tourists began to trickle in, but this has over the decades become a flood, so much so that it's now necessary to buy a ticket to visit.\n\nIn 2011, storms battered the region, leading to cataclysmic rivers of mud pouring down the hillsides and devastating Monterosso and Vernazza. The damage to the park terraces and towns has been repaired, but parts of the coastal path remain closed however, there are alternative routes.\n\n↓ The crumbling remnants of Castella Doria sits above the fishing village of Vernazza.

Ablaze with wild flowers in spring, the park is at its finest from April to May. June to August is crowded and hot. September is still warm, and less busy.\n\n## Getting there\n\nCinque Terre is on the Ligurian coast.

It's in a great location in Riomaggiore, the first of the Cinque Terre villages.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nMountain biking along the park's paths, where it's permitted, is a glorious challenge through maquis and vine-covered hills overlooking periwinkle seas. For superlative cyclists, the Granfondo route through the park is a 151km roller-coaster ride.\n\n## Diving\n\nThe area off the coast is a protected marine zone. Local diving outfits offer the opportunity to explore the rich, gin-clear waters, where you'll spot stingrays, lobsters, eels and scuttling crabs, as well as deep underwater canyons and hidden caves.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe maquis tangling the coastline includes sea fennel, wild capers, rosemary, thyme and lavender. Other common flora are myrtle, juniper and Indian fig. Herring gulls, peregrine falcons and ravens are familiar sights wheeling overhead, while burrowing inland are dormice, weasels, moles, beech martens, badgers, foxes and wild boar, as well as snakes and salamanders. Offshore, keep a keen eye out for whales and dolphins frolicking in the surf.\n\n## BADGER\n\nThese distinctive, nattily black-and-white-striped creatures are nocturnal and, unusually, in Italy feed on olives, as well as their more usual diet of earthworms.\n\n## PEREGRINE FALCON\n\nThe world's fastest birds (they can dive at 320km/h) may be spotted from the Cinque Terre. They're seen around the cliffs, preying on smaller birds and catching them in mid-air.\n\n## WILD BOAR\n\nBoar roam free in the park, feeding on roots and berries, mainly at night, and are not the most popular creatures locally because of the damage they do to crops. You're most likely to spot them in wooded areas.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-55 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Path; No 2)\n\nThis gorgeous coastal path connecting all five villages is the park's most popular route and requires a ticket.

However, there's an alternative, slightly more difficult route, which is a little further inland but still has sea views. Check locally for details - the walk takes around three hours. Beyond Corniglia, the route rapidly and strenuously gains height, but you'll be rewarded by views that linger long in the mind. Wild asparagus, wild garlic, figs, prickly pears and shady olive groves line the track. There are few thrills to match reaching the village of Vernazza, 4km away, curled around its natural harbour. This was one of the places most afflicted by the floods of 2011, but it's been restored to its former citrushued splendour.\n\nStop here at 1960sfounded trattoria Gianni Franzi to explore the narrow, winding streets and lunch on fresh-from-the-sea fish on the square overlooking the ocean.

Decide on a base: all the villages are fairly close together, so you won't need to move each night.\n\nOn the first day, you could walk the section of trail No 2 from Monterosso to Vernazza, starting on a high as you round the corner to look down on Vernazza's fantastical peach-and-rose medieval cluster, which seems almost to lean into the sea. On day two, walk one of the five village sanctuary\n\nMonterosso, fronted by a white-sand beach.\n\nThis is one of the most challenging but most rewarding parts of the trail, a steep, stony path that sometimes clings to the cliff, so that if you meet someone going the opposite way you'll have to carefully squeeze past one another. The views are stupendous at every turn, with the rich vegetation and ancient terraces creating an almost surreally beautiful landscape that plummets to an astoundingly blue sea.

You'll see far fewer people on this inland trail, which is harder than the coastal path but repeatedly thrills with glorious sea glimpses. The first stretch starts from Porto Venere, outside the park to the south, with a humbugstriped church.\n\nThe 8km walk takes you through pine, oak and chestnut forest before ending this section at the Telegrafo (513m). If you've packed a picnic, unwrap it here, overlooking the tangle of fragrant maquis. You'll have glorious views down over the Cinque Terre and its vineyards, and out to sea - on a clear day you can spy the rugged spine of Corsica.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-57 -->\n\nShutterstock | Lukasz Pajor\n\nConnemara National Park\n\n13 I R E L A N D\n\nIreland's signature cliffs and rainy greens crescendo in Connemara, the westerly realm of County Galway that's preyed upon by the Atlantic's wild, unpredictable mood.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-58 -->\n\nT T here's Ireland, and then there's Connemara - everything a visitor expects from the Emerald Isle, but with the volume cranked all the way up to ten. The mountain passes are more dramatic, the coastal vistas are even more breathtaking, and the grass is, quite literally, greener. The region of Connemara, located in the far western reaches of County Galway, has no official boundary, though it largely occupies the realm of jagged peninsulas and lonely loughs (lakes and inlets) west of the Maumturk mountains. Its name comes from an ancient clan that once ruled the area, though today Connemara is more widely known for being the largest Gaeltacht (Irishspeaking region) in the nation. For visitors, the region is Ireland's best offering when it comes to cottage country - especially along the loop known appropriately as Sky Rd.\n\nWithin the greater Connemara area lies Connemara National Park, though it is merely a sliver of land that has come under the jurisdiction of the Irish government - the area around it feels very much a part of the experience, and a trip to the preserve would be woefully incomplete without experiencing the surroundings. Protected within the park's official borders are the skyscraping Twelve Bens, a series of undulating mountains that offer stunning views from the top on a clear day. Diamond Hill, accessible from the visitor centre in Letterfrack, is the national park's most popular climb, promising similar vistas to the more difficult Twelve Bens. Mix and match your hiking with visits to solemn Kylemore Abbey, opulent Ashford Castle and charming Clifden village, and you've got yourself a perfect little parcel of Irish superlatives all within a manageable circle off Rte N59.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go\n\nCounty Galway often sees the least rain and the highest temperatures in May, making early summer the ideal time for hikers. High hills and the rugged, western-facing shoreline mean the weather can be furious and unpredictable throughout the year.\n\n## Getting there\n\nThe park protects a portion of land within a greater district of the same name (the borders of which are ill defined) in western County Galway. The park's visitor centre can be found in Letterfrack.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n29.6 Area covered (sq km)\n\n729\n\nHighest point: Benbaun, part of the Twelve Bens mountain chain (m)\n\n1919\n\nYear of the first transatlantic flight, which landed in Clifden\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-59 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Ashford Castle\n\nEast of the national park, in the village of Cong (famously known as the setting for the Oscar-winning film The Quiet Man ), lies one of the most opulent stays in the Republic. The rambling fortress dates back to 1228, and guests can easily spot the embellishments and expansions in the stone over the years. Today, 83 lavish rooms are tucked inside, blending royal motifs - ornate wallpaper, gilded frames - with modern touches like fresh-faced marble bathrooms. More than 120 hectares of grounds, including a stunning lake, will tempt you to stick around longer.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Trying falconry\n\nOne of world's top centres for training birds of prey is located on the grounds of Ashford Castle, just beyond the park's official borders. Ireland's School of Falconry offers guests private, hour-long 'hawk walks'. A trained falconer accompanies you, feeding the large predatory birds snacks as they swoop from tree to tree hunting small creatures before returning to rest on the comfort of your arm.\n\n## Visiting Kylemore Abbey\n\nHome to a coterie of\n\nBenedictine nuns, Kylemore looks more like a lonely castle\n\n## Quay House\n\nClifden is a great Connemara base, and Quay House offers all the personalised charm you could ever hope for in a B&amp;B-style property. The delightful hosts take good care of their eclectically decorated rooms, some of which have water views.\n\n## Hillside Lodge\n\nAnother Clifden charmer along the stunning Sky Rd beyond the village, Hillside's delights include an interesting vintage-music collection (the owner has had a lengthy career in the industry), a hearty Irish breakfast, welcoming pets, and genuine hospitality from the owners.\n\non a fjord than it does a place of contemplation. Visitors are welcome to explore the property.\n\n## Riding Connemara ponies\n\nBrought to Ireland by the Vikings and interbred with Andalucían horses from warring Spanish galleons, the famous Connemara ponies are compact but elegant beasts and the pride of local equestrian culture. Riding is available throughout the region at several farms and estates.\n\n- ↓ Swept by the Atlantic Ocean winds, Moyrus Beach is a lovely spot for a stroll.\n\nPrevious page: Derryclare Lough.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nOnly 26 mammals are native to Ireland - this relatively small number is due to its geographical separation from the British Isles and Continental Europe over 15,000 years ago. Conversely, more than 400 bird species have been spotted on the island by ornithologists. The somewhat amorphous nature of the park boundaries within the greater region also known as Connemara means that wildlife is generally spotted throughout, with rarer creatures like hares and red deer usually more concentrated within the preserve itself.\n\n## STOAT\n\nUsually spotted at night, stoats (short-tailed weasels) are as prevalent within the park's borders as they are in more urban areas.\n\n## MOUNTAIN HARE\n\nSometimes called the Irish hare, the species is well adapted to colder climates and can manipulate its diet based on available nutrients. In western Ireland the hares consume mostly grass.\n\n## SUNDEW\n\nThe strange, insect-eating sundew looks more like an alien dotted with pink antennae than it does the more conventional carnivorous Venus flytrap.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-60 -->\n\nHike this...\n\n01 Diamond Hill trail Connemara's signature trek starts near the visitor bureau and moves 7km up Diamond Hill, showcasing 360-degree mountain and ocean views.\n\n02 Sky Road Aptly named for the beautiful vistas it affords, the Sky Rd loops through Clifden, taking in the sheer verticality of the peninsula it explores.\n\n## 03 Omey Island\n\nThis tidal island is accessible on foot for only a portion of the day, when the tides have receded. A 6km loop roughly follows the circumference of the granite isle.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-61 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nThe sliver of the Connemara region that belongs to the national park is but a part of a larger system of mountain ridges, lonely peninsulas, farmland and hushed villages.\n\n↓ Protected by a headland from the Atlantic Ocean, Dog's Bay beach is the perfect spot for a summer dip. ↓ Stunning Kylemore Abbey was founded in 1920 for Benedictine nuns fleeing Belgium during WWI.\n\n## A day\n\nA day in the Connemara area, perhaps begun by travelling up from the nearby city of Galway, is best spent doing a driving circuit that takes in a few of the region's best natural and human-made wonders. Follow Rte N59 from Galway, making a right turn onto Rte R344, a smaller road, which trundles through the legendary Inagh Valley, with views of the quiet Lough Inagh and the towering Twelve Bens on the left.\n\nThe end of the road is a different portion of Rte N59, and once you reach the intersection you'll make a left towards Letterfrack. Before you reach the village and the Connemara National Park visitor centre, stop for a few hours at Kylemore Abbey. The stunning estate has several easy walking trails and beautiful Victorian gardens, and the stone mansion itself (while only mildly interesting on the inside) occupies an incredible vantage point over a lake, offering some of the choicest photo opportunities in all the Irish Republic.\n\n## Three days\n\nA long weekend allows visitors to explore the greater Connemara region and not just focus on the fraction of land given the national-park designation. Stunning hiking trails amble beyond the park's headquarters and the Twelve Bens, revealing some of the incredibly scenic cottage country around Clifden - a worthy village in which to hang your hat and explore the appealing shops and pubs. Follow the perfect loop of the Sky Rd just beyond the town centre either by bike or\n\nContinue down Rte N59 towards Clifden for one last walk along the famous Sky Rd - a paved circuit that both starts and finishes in Clifden, servicing a peninsula of private cottages with the best views in the Connemara region. Follow Rte N59 back to Galway afterwards for some fresh seafood at Oscars in the city centre, or check into one of the delightful inns, like Quay House or Hillside Lodge, for the evening and sneak in a few extra hours of walking to fully appreciate the Sky Rd's moniker.\n\non foot, then swoop down into the park proper at Letterfrack for a short walk around Diamond Hill. Try exploring one of the many beaches in Connemara\n\n- be it Ballyconneely or Claddaghduff - on horseback to experience the unique gait of the area's stout-but-athletic ponies.\n\nTuck your hiking shoes away when you arrive at Ashford Castle, Ireland's premier accommodation option. Set in the village of Cong, the rambling castle guards more than 120 hectares of geometric\n\nEnglish gardens and wild forest. The interiors, while thoroughly updated, have retained much of the royal charm one would hope for in castle accommodation. Be sure to enjoy a drink in the wood-panelled bar and have dinner in the George V dining room. Ireland's first school of falconry is located in the grounds, and here travellers can learn about the surprisingly complex work of a falconer and the delicate predator-prey ecosystem endemic to the estate and national park next door.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-62 -->\n\nCuronian Spit National Park\n\n14 LITHUANIA\n\nImagine the desolation of the Sahara, but in Lithuania - you've just pictured the signature curl of orange sand that blankets one of the planet's strangest outcrops.\n\nhen you think of the Baltic, images of frigid winters and bleak Soviet power tend to come to W\n\nmind, but what if we told you that there was a large expanse in Lithuania covered in wild, windswept sand dunes and bearing a striking resemblance to the Sahara - would you believe us? Hard as it may be to fathom, the Curonian Spit - thin like an errant amber hair - shoots across almost 100km of the Baltic Sea promising just that: desolate slopes on which you half expect a Bedouin to invite you into their tent for mint tea.\n\nWhile odd orange dunes are clearly the main attraction for visitors from far away, the national park itself is actually 70 percent pine forest and protects a compelling assortment of mammals, diverse plant life and a huge collection of nesting birds that seek the lagoon waters created along the spit's boundary. The highest point in the park rises a staggering 60m, making it a great place for explorers in any physical condition. Cycling and bird-watching round out the two most popular pastimes within the Curonian Spit's confines, though you'll also find small clusters of adorable summer cottages, and crowds relaxing where the dunes meet the sea to create accidental beaches.\n\nFormed in the third millennium BC, the spit is a geological anomaly where sea currents and wind in just the right ratio deposit sand along an ancient glacial moraine. According to local legend, a giantess created the outcrop as she played along the seashore; the spit has also been long revered in pagan lore as a place of great importance. Protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site, the park depends on surrounding development remaining minimal, lest the land and weather change, forever destroying this fragile and exotic place.\n\n↓  The Curonian Spit's curious dunes are caused by a geological anomaly.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go June and July are by far the best months for exploring the spit, when the weather hovers around 20˚C. August and the autumn months tend to be the wettest, making spring a better bet for low-season visits.\n\nGetting there Lithuania's third- largest city, Klaipeda, is the gateway to the sandy spit.

This guesthouse embodies all the qualities of a classic Nida stay: a prim garden, and blue-and-white gingerbread trim. Visitors have access to bike rentals and a communal kitchen.\n\n## Radisson Blu Hotel\n\nA hallmark of quality in the Baltic, Radisson Blu may bear a chain name, but the property promises top-notch service and easy access to Klaipeda's Old Town. It's a worthy choice for travellers seeking to blend bustling city life and desolate dunes.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Biking\n\nThe Baltic's generally flat landscape lends itself well to the desires of tourists on two wheels, with the 30km stretch from Nida to Juodkrante being one of the most scenic rambles in the entire region. The path meanders through four holiday townships collectively known as Neringa, with their cottage accommodation bedecked in quaint Cape Cod-style detail. The designated bike trail follows the shores of the lagoon around Nida, then veers towards the Baltic side after Pervalka, when the orange dunes morph into skyscraping pines.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park protects several adjacent ecosystems, including a pine forest holding dozens of mammals, a sweeping lagoon with flora and birds, and the desolate dunes.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nWhether you're exploring on foot or by bike, the Curonian's dune-punctuated desert never ceases to amaze.\n\n## A weekend\n\nA holiday retreat for wealthy Lithuanians, the Curonian Spit is made for slow-paced exploration. Base yourself in Nida at the end of the preserve, with its teeny-tiny chequerboard of quaint vacation homes all styled like fairy-tale cottages. Explore the 30km up to the pine-studded village of Juodkrante by bicycle, a feat\n\n## WILD BOAR The most\n\nconspicuous animal in the park wiggles out from the shade of the conifers to rummage through rubbish bins. Take special note of its hooves, which look like dainty black stilettos.\n\neasily managed as the path is remarkably flat. Marvel at the small sandy desert between the eponymous lagoon and the roaring Baltic Sea before it turns into a proper northern forest. The area around Juodkrante embodies a more classic version of what a visitor may envision when they think of the term 'national park', with a plethora of birdlife - don't miss the heron- and cormorantviewing platform - and woodland. Visit the visitor centre in Smiltyne and enjoy the remainder of your time along one of the adjacent beaches, or try your hand at kitesurfing, a popular pastime along the entirety of the Baltic coastline.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-64 -->\n\nLonely Planet | Justin Foulkes\n\nDartmoor National Park\n\n15 ENGLAND\n\nYou can see why legends have grown up about this brooding sweep of moorland in England, which looms above the Devon countryside and is crowned by eerie granite outcrops.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-65 -->\n\nT here's always been something supernatural about Dartmoor. Perhaps it's the tortured granite tors, casting spooky silhouettes against the brooding sky. Or it might be the rumours of links to the occult or the intrigue conjured up by Arthur Conan Doyle in The Hound of the Baskervilles . Or it could just be the scale of the landscape, cracked open to the sky and painted in a primal palette of blood and earth tones by Mother Nature. If pagan gods did come to Earth, this would be their playground.\n\nDespite the tidy infrastructure and waymarked walking trails, Dartmoor has an unmistakable atmosphere of being 'other' to the territory around it: a short drive in any direction will take you to sleepy fishing ports and villages replete with cafes selling Devon cream teas. Dartmoor's shield of granite moorland was thrust upwards as a pluton of volcanic magma some time in the Carboniferous period, at about the same time as the first amphibians were crawling out of prehistoric seas.\n\nWith the passing aeons, tectonic forces pushed the land upwards, while erosion carved downwards, leaving the tough granite of the moors standing proud of the surrounding terrain. The tors on every raised hummock are just the most obvious signs of the vast mass of granite underfoot. Early humans soon realised that there was something special about these dark highlands, leaving a huge collection of stone circles, tombs and primitive settlements scattered across the moors.\n\nFast forward a few hundred thousand years and humans are still captivated by Dartmoor, though these days the main appeal is the opportunity to hike, scramble, mountain bike, kayak, horse ride or climb\n\nover this vast natural adventure playground. Don't underestimate the terrain, though the British Army has been using Dartmoor as a survival training ground since at least the 1800s.\n\n- ↓ A hiker astride Hound Tor; Dartmoor's weathered granite tors, such as Black Tor (previous page), are popular with hikers and climbers alike.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Spring brings lambs and wild flowers to Dartmoor, while summer is prime season for camping, picnics and getting into the great outdoors - and for crowds. It's quieter in autumn, when heather paints the hillsides purple, and winter, when snow airbrushes the higher ground.\n\nGetting there The park boundaries are in Devon, but you can visit just as easily from Cornwall. Exeter, Devon's county town, has the nearest airport; trains run to Exeter, Plymouth and Newton Abbot.\n\n## Park in numbers\n\n954 Area covered (sq km)\n\n621\n\nHighest point: High Willhays Tor (m)\n\n3.1\n\nLength of the world's longest row of standing stones, at Upper Erme (km)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-66 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Bovey Castle\n\nThe pick of the grand country hotels on Dartmoor, Bovey Castle is set in landscaped gardens in a lush green valley near North Bovey. The seemingly Elizabethan manor is actually a late Victorian fake, but the interiors have enough period furniture and damask wallpaper for even the most discerning statelyhome enthusiast. Befitting the regal setting, there's a lavish spa, an 18-hole golf course, and even sloegin-making workshops. OK, you're insulated slightly from the national park, but when the best rooms have private balconies looking out over the hills, you probably won't mind.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Walking the moors\n\nWith dozens of signposted walking routes criss-crossing the moorlands, Dartmoor is a threedimensional Ordnance Survey map for hikers, though you may experience a lingering fear of hearing a monstrous hound baying behind you… There are gentle strolls from car park to tor and challenging multi-day walks weaving right across the national park, but be cautious heading out onto the moors in late autumn and winter - exposure is a risk if the weather deteriorates, and you don't want to wander onto the Ministry of Defence firing range during artillery tests!\n\n## Tor Royal\n\nLovely Tor Royal B&amp;B occupies an almost absurdly picturesque country farmhouse, with a bell tower looking out over the moors. Spot the fleur-de-lys marks left by the original owner, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, personal secretary to the Prince of Wales, later George IV.\n\n## YHA Dartmoor\n\nThe Postbridge YHA scores extra points for being located bang in the middle of the moors. Set in a stone Victorian building, this is the classic YHA experience: no frills, clean sheets and the great outdoors starting right on the front step.\n\n## Tor climbing\n\nVictorians were obsessed with Dartmoor's tors as objects of curiosity, but modern gentlemen and gentlewomen are more interested in climbing them, with rock climbs on most of the main outcrops. Routes are short but challenging, with lots of off-width cracks and difficult exits.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nWith mile after mile of tracks and bridleways, Dartmoor is a natural velodrome. Take your pick from rugged mountain-bike trails like the Princetown and Burrator track or calf-tightening road routes through the heart of the moors.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nDartmoor National Park provides a haven for everything from Dartmoor ponies and otters to, if rumours are to be believed, big cats and escaped marsupials. The moorlands and swamps attract abundant birdlife, including signature species such as buzzards, snipe and curlews, as well as Britain's only poisonous snake, the adder, which survives on a diet of frogs and toads. Spring's carpet of wild flowers attracts myriad butterflies and the enigmatic bee fly, which looks exactly as you would expect.\n\n## BEE FLY\n\nOut on the moors, the sighting of the first bee fly - a curious stingless fly with a fuzzy bee-like body - is regarded as a harbinger of spring.\n\n## SNIPE\n\nBlessed with one of the most charismatic names in the avian kingdom, this long-beaked wader from the sandpiper family is often seen sifting through the swamps for snails, water insects and worms.\n\n## DEVIL'S-BIT SCABIOUS\n\nBees and other pollinators make a beeline (ahem) for the ball-like purple flowers of this member of the honeysuckle family, which creates little punctuation marks of colour in marshy meadows.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-67 -->\n\n/.\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 West Devon Way This 59.5km hike through the western reaches of Dartmoor National Park passes tors, Norman castles and medieval churches perched on granite outcrops.\n\n## 02 Haytor Rocks and Hound Tor\n\nFollowing the route of the Victorian tramway once used to haul stone from the moors, this 12.2km day hike visits two of the park's most dramatic granite outcrops.\n\n## 03 Wistman's Wood and Longaford Tor\n\nThis 7.4km ramble takes in the eerie bower of Wistman's Wood, one of Britain's last prehistoric oak forests, where the devil is said to keep his satanic hounds.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-68 -->\n\n## Itineraries Itineraries\n\nClimb a tor, hike over a hillside or wander a woodland - wherever you go, the moors will cast their spell, sometimes serene, sometimes sombre, sometimes spooky, but always affecting.\n\n↓ Postbridge's ancient clapper bridge was built in the 13th century. ↓ The dark, grim facade of Dartmoor Prison, once the holding place for the UK's most violent prisoners.\n\n## A day\n\nOn a day trip from the coast, it makes sense to head straight for the tors. Hound Tor, creating a sinister silhouette on the skyline between Bovey Tracey and Widecombe-in-the-Moor, was allegedly the inspiration for The Hound of the Baskervilles, and looking at the tormented shapes of the granite outcrops, it's easy to see why.\n\nThe tor backs onto a ruined medieval village, adding to the sense of desolation. Rope-only climbing routes ascend the outcrops, but you can scramble to the top of many of the boulders for sweeping views of clouds skittering over the vast expanse of the moors.\n\nFor a longer leg stretch, you can walk on from Hound Tor to Haytor, or make a long loop via Saddle Tor, Top Tor and Bell Tor. The only caveat: it gets crowded here, so come on a rainy day or start early to beat the rush. After an exhilarating walk/climb/scramble, you can wet your whistle at the Rock Inn, a half-hour tramp east of Haytor.\n\n## Two days\n\nWith two days, you can take on the higher ground. The North Moor rises above the town of Okehampton on the northern fringes of the national park, providing direct access to the highest reaches of moorland.\n\nOn day one, rent a bicycle and follow the Granite Way west from Okehampton, via a string of granite works, viaducts and other relics from Dartmoor's quarrying days. From Meldon Quarry you can detour onto the blasted heath of the high moors to High Willhays (621m), the highest point in\n\n## A week\n\nA week will let you get under the skin of the moors. Base yourself in Widecombe-inthe-Moor and make forays in all directions. To experience Dartmoor's rumoured diabolic links, spend the night - if you dare - in moss-cloaked Wistman's Wood, where Dewer (the Devil) is said to ride out with his wisht hounds, searching for lost souls to drive over the rocks of Dewerstone. From here, it's an easy hop to Princetown's Prison Museum, and north to Castle Drogo. Allow one day to explore the Teign Gorge\n\nDartmoor. Use day two for some cultural activity: in Princetown, the Dartmoor Prison Museum tells the story of the jail that once housed Britain's most notorious criminals (stand up, Acid Bath Haigh and the Mad Axeman!).\n\nEnd with a ramble northeast through a chain of tiny villages: Postbridge, with its 700-year-old bridge; Chagford, with its thatched village square; and Castle Drogo, with the last castle built in England, to plans drawn up by Edward Lutyens.\n\nfrom Castle Drogo, passing woodlands, trickling brooks and the tidy white village of Drewsteignton. There'll be time to cycle the Granite Way across the North Moor and climb Hound Tor and Haytor, or at least scramble over the easier crags. Also make time for the towns around the rim of the national park: Tavistock, home to Buckland Abbey (the one genuinely Elizabethan country house on the moors); Okehampton, with its ruined castle; and Plymouth, for gin-sampling tours and boat trips around Plymouth Sound.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-69 -->\n\n## Doñana National Park\n\n16 SPAIN\n\nWhere Spain's mighty Guadalquivir River empties into the sea, Doñana National Park is a fabulous outpost of sand dunes, rare Mediterranean forests and stunning biodiversity.\n\nD oñana National Park is one of those places where you'll spend most of your visit on the edge of your seat. As you follow ancient byways through the dense undergrowth of cork, oak and pine, deer appear suddenly in the distance, isolated by a shaft of sunlight, or without warning a colourful pheasant runs into view. As thrilling as these sightings are, it's the bewhiskered face of the Iberian lynx, the world's most endangered species of wild cat, or the vast wingspan of the equally imperilled imperial eagle soaring high on the thermals, that will provide you with some of Europe's most memorable wildlifewatching experiences. That's because Doñana is a relic of the past, a refuge for ancient species that once roamed all across the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHow this came to be owes much to the park's history. Eight centuries ago, at a time when the Muslims of Al-Andalus ruled much of Spain's south, the Christian king Alfonso X seized Doñana and turned it into a royal hunting estate. In the centuries that followed, while burgeoning populations and warring armies stripped Spain of its forests and hunted its wild animals to extinction, the occasional royal plaything of Doñana remained intact, an island in a sea of shrinking biodiversity.\n\nDoñana may not be Spain's largest protected area, but it spans an extraordinary range of habitats, of which its famous forests form only a part. Beyond the forests lie open plains shared by lynx and birds of prey, wild boars and genets, badgers and mongooses. These plains in turn yield to vast wetlands, where flamingos and herds of semi-wild horses step through shallows that stretch to a horizon of low sand dunes and then the sea.\n\nToolbox\n\nWhen to go Doñana is accessible year round, but avoid Pentecost, when more than a million pilgrims descend on the gateway town of El Rocio. At this time accommodation is scarce and wildlife elusive.\n\nGetting there Doñana is in Spain's extreme southwest, close to the border with Portugal. It is adjacent to El Rocio, which in turn is south of Almonte, off the Huelva-Sevilla motorway.\n\nPark in numbers 543 Area covered (sq km)\n\n76 Number of Iberian lynx (in 2015) 360 Bird species recorded\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-70 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nHotel La Malvasia Staying in El Rocio makes the most sense, allowing you to get an early start and stay inside the park until sunset. The pick of the places is Hotel La Malvasia, trim in its terracotta and whitewash and surrounded by palm trees like an Andalucían postcard. Overlooking the marshes, this truly magisterial building has rooms brimful of character, including rustic tiled floors, vintage photos of the town and iron bedsteads in floral designs.\n\n## Hotel Toruño\n\nAn attractive villa overlooking the marismas (marshes), Toruño has 30 well-appointed rooms. Some have marsh views, so you can see the spoonbills breakfasting when you wake. The restaurant dishes up generous portions.\n\n## Hospedería El Cazadero Real\n\nIn the heart of El Rocio, this attractive old inn has decent rooms. Those upstairs have views out over the wetlands and the ornate Ermita de El Rocio, the town's celebrated church.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Driving\n\nThe only way to explore Doñana is in a vehicle with an accredited guide. There are numerous operators in El Rocio that organise two- to three-hour driving safaris through the national park. These follow set routes and you'll usually share the vehicle with eight to 10 other paying customers. It's also possible to arrange private forays. Guides know the best places to see lynx and are experts in bird identification.\n\n## Walking\n\nThe national park is bordered on the north side by a parque natural , a more accessible protected zone where you may walk around on your own. Ask for directions from El Rocio, then walk along the sandy trails in search of lynx.\n\nExploring El Rocio There's nowhere quite like El Rocio, Doñana's gateway village, and it's an essential element in the Doñana experience. Streets here are unpaved, horses are everywhere and it feels like the Wild West but with numerous Spanish twists.\n\nGetty Images | antonio arcos aka fotonstudio photography; Luis Davilla\n\n## Drive this...\n\n## 01 Coto del Rey\n\nThis northern area of Mediterranean forest is home to the planet's highest density of Iberian lynx. Beautiful stands of trees and quiet driving tracks make this the place to be late in the day.\n\n02 La Viciosa and around A combination of dense foliage and open country in the heart of the park makes La Viciosa another lynx hot spot, with many sightings close to sunset or sunrise.\n\n## 03 Marismas\n\nThese wetlands are a twitcher's paradise, and their far southern reaches are generally home to flamingos at any time of the day.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-71 -->\n\n## What to spot...\n\nDoñana's wildlife is most active during the two hours after sunrise and the last couple of hours before sunset. The lynx is most commonly seen in the north, where there is sufficient cover. Other mammals, including foxes and hedgehogs, are best seen in the same forests or in the plains on the forests' southern fringe. Birds of prey are common throughout the park, but the southern and coastal wetlands are home to the largest number of species, especially water birds.\n\n## SPANISH IMPERIAL EAGLE\n\nThis large brown eagle has a 2m wingspan. Numbers fell to 30 pairs in the 1960s, but there are now more than 300 in Spain, thanks to intensive conservation programmes.\n\n## COMMON GENET\n\nThe cat-like genet, which is mostly nocturnal, is a small mammal with leopard spots along its flanks, a dark stripe along its spine, and a fox-like face.

Early-morning and late-afternoon nature drives will ensure you see the park at its best and give you a fighting chance of spotting its signature wildlife. Make sure one of your drives includes a visit to the former royal hunting pavilion, a lovely, quintessentially Andalucían structure where kings and queens stayed while on excursion\n\n## Two days\n\nAfter the full first day, take a morning or afternoon to walk east of El Rocio into the Coto del Rey section of forest just outside the park. From the main track where, if you're lucky, you'll see some of El Rocio's many horse-drawn carts heading to and from the town - you can see through the fence into the national park; sightings of lynx along here are reasonably common. Alternatively, venture into the forest to the north to see if you spy a lynx there. In the afternoon, drive for two or more hours around in the park. Don't forget to scan the nearby trees for nesting storks. In between drives, spend your day in El Rocio, a singular place with sandy streets, horse corrals and a remarkable church, the Ermita de El Rocio, the epicentre of a powerful annual pilgrimage; on Sunday, expect crowds dressed in traditional Spanish finery. Local restaurants serving Andalucían specialities are worth lingering in, with the widest selection of places in the thoroughfares around the hermitage.\n\nto Sanlúcar de Barrameda. This pretty Andalucían sherry town looks across the mouth of the Guadalquivir River (which Columbus sailed down en route to the Americas) towards Doñana and has a national park visitor centre with interesting displays. At the centre, arrange a guided boat-and-4WD excursion into the park. Such visits focus on the park's coastal scenery and birdlife seeing a lynx down here is near impossible - and nicely round out your experience with its many charms.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-73 -->\n\n## 17 MONTENEGRO\n\nDurmitor National Park\n\nA glorious kingdom of sky-scraping peaks, jade-green glacial lakes, ancient black pines, mossy forests and plunging river canyons, Montenegro's Durmitor National Park is pure perfection.\n\nLonely Planet | Julian Love\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-74 -->\n\n|\n\nἘῈ\n\nν\n\nکین\n\nM\n\n;\n\n“‏\n\nسے\n\n;\n\nk\n\nو\n\nسر\n\nk\n\no‏\n\n﹒˙-ˉˍ\\_ˊ′ˍ】ˍ˙'\n\n—\n\n&amp;\n\nm‏\n\n-\n\nJ\n\nض\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-75 -->\n\nN o matter from which side you approach Durmitor National Park, you will be in awe - the glorious mountain peaks are rugged, smooth, sloping and jagged, all at the same time. The ancient pine trees dot the mountainsides with perfect cones, some reaching 50m high. And amid all this are the 18 glacial lakes that range in colour from frosty blues to deep navy and turquoise, like precious beads scattered on the massif. Durmitor has 48 peaks above 2000m in altitude, with the highest, Bobotov Kuk, measuring 2523m, making the park the perfect place for hiking, especially in the warmer months. There are spectacular karst or forest trails, and stunning views that stretch hundreds of kilometres.\n\nThe park's flora is dominated by forests of pine, birch, juniper, fir and beech, and, notably, Durmitor boasts one of Europe's last virgin black-pine forests. The vast range of fauna includes clouds of breathtaking butterflies, 163 species of bird and some 50 types of mammal, among them the grey wolf, brown bear and European wildcat. And beneath the surface of the park's rich waters hides the endangered Danube salmon.\n\nInscribed on the Unesco World Heritage List since 1980, Durmitor National Park also includes Europe's deepest river canyon, which is a stunning 1.3km from top to bottom. Cradling the Tara River, it makes rafting down the majestic torrent an even more unforgettable experience.\n\nThe park was founded in 1952, though its conservation history dates back to 1907, when Black Lake was declared a protected area. Today, just under 2000 people live in Durmitor, most of them shepherds - the region's heights and remoteness have always been a deterrent to settlers.\n\n## Toolbox\n\n## When to go\n\nDecember to March is ski season, with spring, summer and autumn best for hiking and rafting. The mountains are cool even on the hottest days, though spring and autumn are particularly divine for their wild flowers and turning leaves, respectively.\n\n## Getting there\n\nDurmitor sits in northwestern Montenegro, edged by three river canyons: Tara to the north, Piva to the west and Komarnica in the south.

There's a garden with wooden tables and chairs for summer days, when breakfast and dinner can be had with the fantastic views of the plateau unfolding before you.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Rafting\n\nThe deepest canyon in Europe, Tara River Canyon is unmissable. It's 80km long and 1.3km deep, and it's best seen from within, so rafting it is the natural choice. The water is potable, so fill your bottle as you rush down the 25km of foaming river bends. Tours start in the morning; watch the light change as the day progresses, and observe the plant and animal life on the canyon walls.

Previous page: the park has been on the Unesco World Heritage List since 1980.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nDurmitor National Park sits in the Dinaric Alps, and its wide range of altitudes gives it both Mediterranean and alpine microclimates. There are 163 bird species, including the peregrine falcon and the golden eagle, which soar over 400-year-old black-pine trees. The rich underwater fauna includes the endangered Danube salmon. But the real sign of Durmitor's extraordinary ecological preservation is the presence of big predators such as wolves and brown bears.\n\n## EUROPEAN WILDCAT\n\nThe great-grandparent of the domestic cat, the wildcat, with its long, thick, brown-striped coat, looks a lot like a tabby cat.

Gaze up at the 50m-high pine trees, many of which can be up to 400 years old, and expect to see grazing herds on alpine meadows. Spot maples and beech trees and admire the karstic rock eagles that soar in the skies above. The five hours of hiking can be interrupted by a visit to Ledena Pecina (Ice Cave) - the route to the cave forks off about halfway along the path to Lokvice. Inside the cave, you can see ice stalactites and stalagmites, which remain intact year-round. Take warm clothes for the cave, since the temperature hovers constantly just a few degrees above zero. Enjoy the afternoon on the shingle shores of Black Lake; you can hire a rowing boat for a spin on the lake itself.\n\nformations that surround you. Have lunch on the summit, enjoying the views of the massif stretching out all around, and then return to Black Lake; in high summer, reward yourself with a dip and a rest on the shingle beach.\n\nDay four should be spent exploring the glacial lakes on light walks; from Black Lake, walk on for an hour and a half to Jablan Lake under the imposing cliffs of Crvena Greda. Nearby is Zminje Lake, cupped by centennial fir and juniper forests, and Barno Lake, shrouded by conifer trees. If you're visiting in springtime, Škrčka Lakes should still be snowy. Unpack your lunch on the grass by any one of the lakes. Listening to birdsong in the shade here has to be one of the most heavenly experiences that life can bring.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-79 -->\n\nGetty Images | HAUSER Patrice/hemis.fr\n\nÉcrins National Park\n\nWatch as dawn illuminates the pearly summit of Barre des Écrins, and hike to rocky ledges and along shepherds' trails worn smooth over the centuries.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-80 -->\n\nI magine the frostbite, racing pulses and top-of-the-world exhilaration English climbers Edward Whymper, Horace Walker and AW Moore must have experienced as they scrambled up scree-driven slopes, braving whatever the elements threw at them and hacking out steps in the rock, to finally crest the 4102m summit of Barre des Écrins on 25 June 1864. Since then the mighty peak has been the stuff of mountaineering legend. One glimpse of its gnarled, arrow-shaped summit and Glacier Blanc spilling down its flanks tells you everything you need to know about Écrins. These mountains are not gentle. They are great, dark, forbidding monsters of gneiss and ice, rearing above valleys and meadows like shark's fins. Like the climbers who tackle them, they are hardcore.\n\nEdward Whymper and co might have been the first peak-baggers, but they were by no means the first to discover Écrins. Bronze Age remnants point to a long history of settlement, as do footpaths pounded into shape by shepherds and smugglers over centuries. In the 19th century, intrepid mountaineers and guides came to find their thrill in this mountainous region, tucked in southeastern France and nudging the Italian border.\n\nIt is this raw wilderness coupled with the park's off-the-radar remoteness that gives Écrins a peace rarely found in the French Alps. Go today and you'll have trails - all 700km of them - virtually to yourself. There's one with your name on it, whether you fancy a gentle amble to a looking-glass lake, a half-day hike to a high mountain refuge or a multi-day expedition into the backcountry, where fang-like peaks reveal snarling tongues of glaciers. And when you tire of walking, you can pit yourself against\n\nfour-thousanders, pedal Tour de Francestyle to Alpe d'Huez, canyon, ski, ice climb or simply revel in scenery that makes you feel glad to be alive.\n\n↓ Écrins National Park has many spectacular places to pitch a tent. Previous page: La Meije (3983m) looms over the village of La Grave.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Écrins is high-Alpine terrain with sharply defined seasons. Summer is best for hiking, and the park rarely feels crowded even in peak months. Dry, mild weather often sweeps up from neighbouring Provence. Winter brings hefty snowfalls, with skiing and boarding at resorts fringing the park. Golden days and forests define autumn.\n\nGetting there The park stretches between Bourg d'Oisans, Briançon and Gap. The closest airport is in Grenoble, 92km from the western gateway village of Bourg d'Oisans.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n918 Area covered (sq km)\n\n4102\n\nHighest point: Barre des Écrins (m)\n\n800,000\n\nApproximate number of visitors annually\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-81 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Hôtel les Vallois\n\nWith front-row views of glaciated mountains, this chalet in Vallouise is brilliantly positioned for hiking and skiing at nearby Puy-StVincent. The rooms are kitted out with pine furnishings and downy bedding, and many have mountainfacing balconies. Besides the heartfelt bienvenue (welcome), it's the little touches that appeal: staff can advise on activities, there's a pool and the restaurant is top-notch.\n\n## Hotel de la Chaussée\n\nThe Bonnaffoux family has run this chalet for five generations - since 1892, in fact.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nIf you've ever watched the Tour de France and pictured yourself tearing up a mountain pass in a blaze of sweat, adrenaline and Lycra, now's your chance to live the dream. Bourg d'Oisans is the trailhead for the notorious 14km road that swings around 21 hairpins to the mountain resort of Alpe d'Huez (1860m) - a heart-pumping ascent of 1100m. After the gruelling climb, naturally, comes the spirit-lifting descent.\n\n## Snowshoeing and crosscountry skiing\n\nGliding through snowy forests in quiet exhilaration on cross-country\n\nClose to Briançon's walled old town, it fulfils every Alpine fantasy, with wood-clad rooms and fabrics in Christmassy reds and greens. The restaurant does a brisk trade in cheese-laden classics, from tartiflette (cheese, potato and onion tart) to raclette.\n\n## Ferme Noémie\n\nThis family-run affair near Bourg d'Oisans is a cracking base for exploring the national park it's particularly popular with road and mountain bikers. Pitch a tent from April to October or stay in a barn-style apartment (available year round).\n\nskis or padding up to mountain ridges in snowshoes, with a crisp blue sky overhead, is nothing short of magical. Vallouise and Puy-StVincent are fine bases, with marked, well-groomed trails. Hire gear at local shops.\n\n## Adventure sports\n\nFancy upping the adventure a notch? Major park resorts and villages, Briançon and Bourg d'Oisans included, have bureaux des guides that are one-stop activity shops, offering everything from gorge canyoning to vie ferrate (fixed-rope trails), mountain climbing, ice climbing and off-piste skiing.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nÉcrins is rippled with 150 peaks over 3000m, their summits eternally ice capped. Dark, serrated mountains and glacier fields drop to meadows speckled with gentians, buttercups, edelweiss and saxifrage, and woodlands of spruce, Swiss pine, beech, alder and juniper. The park's remoteness attracts abundant wildlife: chamois and ibex on rocky slopes, marmots and snow hares in pastures, black grouse and willow ptarmigan in woods, and griffon vultures, golden eagles and pygmy owls in the skies.\n\n## GOLDEN EAGLE\n\nThe park shelters France's largest population of golden eagles (37 pairs). These agile predators soar on thermal currents and eye up prey from rocky ledges. They are true lovebirds and pairs stay together for life.\n\n## WILLOW PTARMIGAN\n\nA member of the grouse family, the ground-dwelling willow ptarmigan struts around the park's forests. It changes its feathers from brown to white in winter. Listen for its gurgling cackle of a call.\n\n## MARMOT\n\nThese podgy, burrow-dwelling rodents, found around 2000m, are related to the squirrel and native to the Alps. They are sociable and live in colonies. Like meerkats, they regularly post sentries, who whistle once for an air predator and twice for a ground predator.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-82 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 GR54\n\nAmong France's most fabled grandes randonnées (longdistance hikes), this 198km, eight- to 10-day circuit begins in Bourg d'Oisans, plunges into the park's glacier-capped wilds and involves some steep ascents and scrambling.\n\n## 02 Refuge du Pelvoux\n\nThis challenging 14.3km, seven-hour round hike starts in Ailefroide and clambers past rocky ledges and grassy slopes to a refuge with stirring views of ice-frosted mountains.\n\n## 03 Pigeon Loft Loop, Gioberney\n\nWith exhilarating views of the Rouies glaciers (3589m), Gioberney is often dubbed the 'French Himalayas'.

Get the inside scoop on hiking and a decent map from the Maison du Parc, then nip into the village's museum. From here, strike out on one of the outstanding hiking trails - you could attempt a section of the wild GR54 - or slip into a mountain-bike saddle to tackle the 21 switchbacks up to Alpe d'Huez, capped by the summit of Piz Blanc. Straddling slopes that reach from 1250m to 3330m, this sunny bowl of an Alpine resort is one of the finest bases in the French Alps for outdoor activities. Back in Bourg d'Oisans, go for pizza at La Falaise before bedding down for the night at Ferme Noémie.\n\nRise early on day two to see first light playing on colossal mountain faces. Now it's time for a distractingly scenic drive east along the northern fringes of the park to Briançon, past thundering falls, sheer cliffs and jagged peaks topped by glaciers and skirted with larch forests. But you'll need your wits about\n\n## Four days\n\nTag on an extra couple of days in the national park and you won't be sorry. On day three, penetrate the park further by driving on to Vallouise, which looks like a village straight out of a snow globe, with its cute stone-and-timber chalets, Romanesque church and staggering mountain backdrop. Some of Écrins' finest hiking begins right here and in neighbouring Ailefroide. You could dive into truly mountainous terrain on the 14.3km circuit up to the Refuge du Pelvoux (and you - the local attitude to overtaking on hairpin bends is pas de problème .\n\nClose to the Italian border, Briançon opens up more fabulous hiking country and is the jumping-off point for pulse-racing activities from canyoning to ski touring, depending on the season.

When the flakes begin to fall, excellent cross-country skiing and snowshoeing allow you to tiptoe into the silent hinterland. Dinner is an Alpine feast of glorious cheese - raclette, tartiflette or fondue - at La Table de Nany, before a peaceful night's kip at Hôtel les Vallois.\n\nOn your final day, end on a high - quite literally - by delving right into the heart of the park to Gioberney, where a striking round walk to the Pigeon Loft begins. You'll be totally immersed in stark Alpine country: over millennia, glaciers have bulldozed out this landscape of ice, scree and cirques. Stay the night at 2423m Refuge du Pigeonnier or return before the light begins to fade.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-84 -->\n\n## Parco dell'Etna\n\n19 I TALY\n\nIn Italy's Parco dell'Etna, walk with lava and legends on Europe's tallest and most tempestuous volcano, where unspoilt nature endures amid the ash and cinders.\n\nGetty Images |  Jeremy Woodhouse\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-85 -->\n\nT he farmers of Sicily have always known that the fertile soils under their feet were forged by volcanoes, so the brooding cone-shaped peak of Mount Etna could be considered the ultimate elephant in the room. This looming mass of basalt lava is both Europe's highest volcano and its most active, belching ash and fire into the skies over Catania and Taormina with alarming regularity. This hasn't stopped farmers and winemakers from making extensive use of the lower slopes, but locals have avoided living too close to the crater-scarred summit, creating a de facto conservation area long before the Parco dell'Etna was founded in 1987.\n\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Etna was the home of the cyclops Polyphemus, the fearsome one-eyed monster who captured Odysseus, but even older legends link Etna to the Gigantes, giants who challenged the gods of Olympus for control of the cosmos. The Romans upgraded Etna in their mythology to become the workshop of the tempestuous god Vulcan, lord of metalworkers and the forge - and seeing Etna spitting plumes of molten lava into the night sky, it's easy to see where they got the idea!\n\nBut that's ancient history. Etna today is a place to get close to elemental forces - particularly if the volcano is putting on one of its famous strombolic light shows and, conversely, to appreciate the surreal peace and quiet around those cones that are still slumbering, within sight of the built-up bustle of Catania and Taormina. This is prime walking country, and even prime skiing country in winter, but many visitors are content to drift around the vineyards on the fringes of Parco dell'Etna,\n\nsampling local vintages with the sombre summit of the volcano rising imposingly against the horizon.\n\n↓ Hikers climb to the ash-covered summit of Mt Etna (3350m). Previous page: the volcano shadows the town of Cesarò.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Come from June to August for prime walking conditions on the upper slopes, but expect plenty of day trippers from Catania and Taormina. December to March is ski season in Nicolosi and Linguaglossa.\n\nGetting there Catania is the closest gateway to Etna, served by flights from Europe and ferries from the Italian mainland and Malta. Buses run daily from Catania to the cable-car station at Rifugio Sapienza.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n581\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n3350\n\nHighest point (m)\n\n475\n\n(BC) First recorded eruption of the Etna volcano\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-86 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Rifugio Sapienza\n\nIf you like being close to the action, bed down just metres from the lower cable-car station at this mountain refuge, the main departure point for the smoking summit. The refuge has a hint of ski lodge, but the plumes of steam from the summit create a surreal backdrop. The hotel has a fine restaurant, serving some of the produce raised on Etna's fertile slopes, though the wood-fired pizza oven may be too vivid a reminder of the lava bubbling below.\n\nAgriturismo San Marco On Etna's less-visited\n\n## Do this!\n\nClimbing into a crater The main attraction at Mount Etna is fairly obvious everyone wants to get up on top of the volcano to peer into the steaming crater. In fact, there are four primary cones - Bocca di Nord-Est, Voragine, Bocca Nuova and Cratere di Sud-Est. Which you can get close to will depend on how active the volcano is feeling on any given day (bear in mind that this is Europe's most active volcano). Voragine has been belching fire with particular regularity in recent years, including some stunning strombolic eruptions.\n\nnorthern slopes, this family-run agriturismo is agreeably rustic, right down to the hearty, homestyle Sicilian meals prepared in the farm kitchen by Mrs Rosaria. The owners run a host of excursions, including eco-walks around the volcano.\n\n## Hotel Villa Dorata\n\nSet in the former home of Duke Giovan Battista Paternò Castello di Roccaromana, this antique-filled heritage property basks in front of stunning views over the coastal plain, just 1.5km from the nearest crater. For outdoorsy types, the forest starts right outside the front door.\n\n## Skiing a volcano\n\nAs Sicily's highest point, Etna makes for a surprisingly good ski destination. From December to March, the upper slopes are dusted with snow and eight pistes offer lifts and other ski essentials, accessible from either Nicolosi or Linguaglossa.\n\n## Sampling the local plonk\n\nEtna's volcanic soils are rich and fertile, and winemakers crowd the lower slopes. Many wineries are open for tastings of the delicious local Etna DOC vintages. Expect plenty of fruit, strong alcohol and, some claim, hints of mineral smokiness.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe richness of wildlife in Parco dell'Etna is perhaps unexpected considering the unstable environment, but the volcano is home to martens, Sicilian foxes, European wildcats, peregrine falcons, golden eagles and even porcupines. Of course, they couldn't survive here without the mice, voles and other small rodents who scurry between the lava flows. In fact, the volcano isn't all sand and clinker; the lower slopes are cloaked in vineyards and oak and pine forests that give shelter to abundant birds and butterflies.\n\nMARTEN These robust mustelids - in the same family as otters and weasels - were once as common as rabbits, but farmers grew tired of their poultry-pinching ways, leading to a big decline in their numbers.\n\nSICILIAN FOX Hunted to the brink of extinction, Sicily's largest predator is making a comeback on Etna, where its red coat provides excellent camouflage in the russet volcanic sands.\n\n## PORCUPINE Certainly Etna's\n\nmost exotic resident, the crested porcupine clings on in warmer areas below 1300m. Despite superficial similarities, this prickly customer is more closely related to the hare than the hedgehog.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-87 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Rifugio Sapienza to the summit\n\nIt's a 5km scramble to reach the tormented landscape around the summit craters, but the approach offers spectacular views over vineyards to Catania.\n\n## 02 Climbing Monte Zoccolaro\n\nWhen activity builds up to dangerous levels in the main craters, the best vantage point is the peak of Monte Zoccolaro, reached by a 2km hike from Zafferana Etnea.\n\n## 03 Zafferana Etnea to\n\nthe Valle del Bove This rewarding 10km tramp goes into the dragon's den of the Valle del Bove, moving from peaceful rural countryside to black lava and fuming vents.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-88 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nCome face to face with nature's fury on the slopes of Sicily's tallest mountain; if you're lucky, the volcano may even put on the full lava show for your benefit.\n\n↓ While the lower slopes of Mt Etna are famed for their fertility, towards the summit little grows but cushions of soapwort ( Saponaria sicula ). ↓ Mt Etna is an excellent and, occasionally, dramatic ski\n\n- destination.\n\nmoney, it's best to approach the summit on foot to connect with the spirit of the volcano - save the jeep and cable-car ride for the journey downhill, when you'll have earned the right to take the easy way down. Needless to say, the views are pretty special from the 500m ascent on the Funivia dell'Etna cableway. If you do brave the 5km climb from Rifugio Sapienza to the summit under your own steam, you'll tramp through a landscape painted in a diabolical palette of colours\n\n- hellish reds, ash greys,\n\n## A day\n\nWith only a day to appreciate the Parco dell'Etna, it pays to get straight up into cinder country. Nicolosi is the gateway to the southern slopes of Etna, and buses rumble daily to Rifugio Sapienza, on the edge of the desert of ash and clinker that surrounds the active cones at the summit. Even in summer, the approach can be chilly and exposed you are above 3000m, after all - but this only adds to the drama as you crunch over the cinders spewed out by past eruptions. For our\n\n## Four days\n\nWith several days at Etna, there's no need to charge headlong to crater-town. Prime yourself for the volcanic encounter by exploring the handsome, stone-cut streets of Catania, which narrowly escaped a fiery death in 1669, when flumes of lava reached the city walls.\n\nOn day two, swing by Piazza Duomo and pay your respects to the lava-cut elephant that is Catania's official symbol, then head to Linguaglossa, on the northern flanks of Etna, and roll out to the Gambino burnt umbers - before finally reaching the ominous cones at the tip of the mountain. Each of the four craters has its own brooding character, but if any of the cones is delivering the full sound-and-fury package, it's best to view the lava fountains from a safe distance. You'll be able to get closer to one of the other cones for a glimpse into Vulcan's furnace.\n\nVini vineyard to sample the lip-smacking combination of traditional grape varietals, Sicilian sunshine and volcanic Etna terroir.\n\nOn day three, perform a ritual circuit around the base of the mountain on the Ferrovia Circumetnea train, basking in front of classic Etna views around the lava-stone village of Randazzo. Make time for a gentle amble through the serene forests around the Rifugio Ragabo before you settle down in the pretty hill town of Nicolosi for the night.\n\nDay four is summit time, so follow the craggy trail from Rifugio Sapienza, with the dry crunch of cinders ringing in your ears. As well as the active craters, make sure that you admire the views over the Valle del Bove, the fuming depression created by the collapse of an ancient lava cone. Finish off by winding your way back to Nicolosi, to sample volcano-grown farm-fresh produce at Antico Orto dei Limono, in the rustic setting of a vintage oliveoil and wine press.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-89 -->\n\n## Gauja National Park\n\n20 LATVIA\n\nLatvia's Gauja National Park is a realm of infinite pines spiced with millennia of wartime scars, from ancient tribal rites and medieval strongholds to bizarre Soviet geometry.\n\nD ense layers of coniferous forest cast soothing shade on the snaking Gauja River as it wends its way across Vidzeme, Latvia's eastern region. The vast realm - bright green in the summer months and blanketed in white, unsullied snow in winter - became the Baltic nation's first official national park in 1973, protecting sandstone cliffs, natural springs, dozens of lakes and a truly incredible amount of biodiversity almost two full decades before the country reinstated its independence from Mother Russia.\n\nBut Gauja National Park offers much more than a diverse ecosystem of migratory birds and mammals; it also fosters a swathe of land that has, for thousands of years, been a tree-filled nexus of trade and turmoil. Tribes bearing names not too dissimilar from Game of Thrones characters fought vicious battles in the Gauja, staking land claims by creating large earthen mounds. Medieval warfare was etched into the ground with imposing turrets of stone - the castles at Turaida and Cēsis remain even today as poignant reminders that control of the park's namesake river was always a bloody undertaking.\n\nRelics from modern history scar the terrain in equal measure. The dominant Soviet presence after WWII had little regard for natural preservation, adding Communist-style tenement blocks throughout the landscape. Many have been torn down, others have been transformed to suit modern use, but a few of the structures are well worth exploring in greater detail. The Soviet Olympic bobsled team, for example, trained within the park's confines along a track that looks like some kind of apocalyptic concrete confetti, and deeper within the sky-scraping evergreens is a giant nuclear-fallout shelter encased in iron and situated many metres below the earth.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go July and August are best for exploring, when the weather's warm and live music wafts through the castle ruins - celebrate the solstice with all-night pagan rituals. Winter pairs park skiing with a steam in a local pirts (sauna).\n\nGetting there The Gauja is an hour from Rīga, Latvia's capital, and can be accessed by suburban train, bus or private vehicle. The park features two towns: the century-old leisure village of Sigulda and the medieval stronghold of Cēsis.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n917.5 Area covered (sq km)\n\n1214\n\nYear construction began on Turaida Stone Castle\n\n1200 Length of Soviet luge and bobsled track (m)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-90 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nUngurmuiža Manor\n\nA vestige of Latvia's infamous feudal times when wealthy German merchants co-opted the land and employed locals as their serfs, this stunning wooden mansion is the only Baroque-era manor left standing in the whole of the country. Grand portraits, porcelain furnaces and restored wooden beams transport visitors back to the lap of luxury in the 1700s. Two of the manor's rooms are available for overnight guests; there are additional accommodations in the old schoolhouse next door.\n\n## Hotel Ezeri\n\nLoaded with all the mod cons you could desire, Ezeri bills itself as a spa resort, but the real drawcard is its lakeside cedar 'country sauna' that's only available for those in the know.\n\n## Hotel Bergs\n\nIf you're planning to base yourself in Rīga then be sure to consider a stay at boutique Hotel Bergs. Set on one of the grand boulevards of the city centre, the hotel blends traditional manorhouse decor with sleek glass embellishments.\n\n## Do this!\n\nVisiting Līgatne bunker Hidden deep in the forests of the Gauja is a crumbling convalescent home, its perpendicular Bauhaus-esque edges starkly contrasting with the rambling natural landscape. While still in use as a rehabilitation centre, the structure had another purpose, which wasn't generally known until the mid-2000s: underneath it lay a massive secret Soviet bunker, the fallout shelter for Russian officials should there be a nuclear attack. Tours are readily available.\n\n## Bobsledding\n\nOnce the training ground of the Soviet bobsled team, Sigulda still boasts its original concrete practice track. Visitors can give it a whirl with a proper retro luge in the winter months, or test drive the summer bob.\n\nTouring Cēsis Castle Have all your medieval fantasies come true at the perfectly preserved Cēsis Castle.

Famed for its towering pines and quiet lakes, the land can be shady and swampy at times, with hidden caves and crumbling ruins strewn about here and there. Keep an eye out for the park's 900 species of plant and 150 types of bird.\n\n## ELK (MOOSE)\n\nElk are plentiful throughout the park and the rest of the country, and are often hunted for sport and game meat.\n\n## RACCOON DOG\n\nOriginally from East Asia, the raccoon dog was introduced to the Baltics as a fur-bearing animal and has managed to fully integrate into the predator-prey ecosystem.\n\n## WHITE STORK\n\nLatvian farmers believe the stork brings good luck and fertility, and they hope that the large birds nest on their property.

Start in Sigulda, around 60km from Rīga, which was purposebuilt as the leisure gateway to the forested expanse. Here you can try out the retro-cool bobsled track constructed for the Soviet Olympic team. Careen down the concrete track at speeds of up to 125km/h as you breathe in the Gauja's thick scent of pine.\n\nStick with the Russian theme at the hidden\n\n## A weekend\n\nTake the train out to Sigulda for an eventful weekend. Start by getting the blood rushing on a visit to a local pirts (Latvian sauna). There are several private pirts to choose from in the area, and all of them offer the same thing: sweating it out in your birthday suit at baking temperatures while mixing in swigs of beer (or shots of vodka) and invigorating splashes in a neighbouring lake or pond.\n\nCrank the adrenaline up one more notch in the heart of the Sigulda township, where you bunker in Līgatne, just a dozen kilometres up the road, and get a lesson in Soviet propaganda. If you time your visit over lunch you can dine in the dank galley amid plastic flowers that haven't left the room since they finished the bunker at the height of the Cold War.\n\nFollow the road up to Cēsis to take a giant leap further back in time as you wander through the medieval ruins of one of northern Europe's most picturesque castles by candlelight.\n\nhave the choice of bungee jumping from the cross-river cable car, bobsledding down an old Soviet track, and trying out other novelty pursuits such as the Aerodium vertical wind tunnel, or Vells, the highest climbing tower in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe warmer months lend themselves well to cycling - a worthy pursuit for your second day. Bike between Līgatne and Cēsis while uncovering nature trails that follow the ancient warpaths of the tribal Livonians.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-93 -->\n\n## Parco Nazionale del Golfo di Orosei e del Gennar gentu\n\nStrike out into near-vertical ravines, puzzle over prehistory and tick off pearl-white bays like rosary beads in Sardinia's biggest national park, where limestone mountains razor above celestial-blue sea.\n\nhe SS125 corkscrews over mountaintops cloaked in juniper, holm oak and olive, swinging haphazardly around bends that redefine the word 'hairpin'. You crunch gears, say three Hail Marys, and dodge wild pigs, flocks of fearless sheep and the occasional hell-bent Fiat driver. The views, too, are quite simply distracting. On one side unfolds a broad valley, quilted with lush greens, carved by ravines and buckled with ragged limestone peaks. On the other, cliffs sheer down to the bluest of blue seas. You take the helter-skelter road down to Cala Gonone and there - sweet Jesus! - is the full sweep of the Golfo di Orosei, shimmering like quicksilver as day fades to dusk. T\n\nDipping into the heart of the Parco Nazionale del Golfo di Orosei e del Gennargentu, the drive along the coastal road from Orosei to Baunei is way up there with Italy's best road trips. Here the mountains of the Gennargentu collide abruptly with the sea to form a colossal amphitheatre. And here nature puts on a sensational performance: cliffs are riven with false inlets, pockmarked with caves, stippled with rock arches and pinnacles. In between hide horseshoe-shaped bays that beggar belief, with pebbles so white and water so exquisitely blue they look digitally enhanced.\n\nWho can say what memories you will take away? Perhaps they will be of your kayak paddle slicing through topaz waters to reach castaway bays, or of stumbling across Bronze Age Nuraghic settlements in the silent hinterland, or maybe of watching a full moon hang above the gulf like a stage prop as cicadas strike up their twilight drone. Indeed, whether you are admiring grandstand views of Gola Su Gorropu canyon or the spring beauty of the valleys spread gold with mimosa and broom, the magic of this park will settle over you as gently and clingingly as pollen.\n\n↓ The glittering white sands of cliff-lined Cala Luna beach.\n\nToolbox When to go Wild flowers daub the landscape in spring, a terrific season for hiking, climbing and cycling. Avoid July and August, when crowds swell, rates skyrocket, temperatures soar and roads get congested. Autumn is often fine, with clear skies and warm days.\n\nGetting there The closest airport is Olbia, around 1½ hours north. Alghero (to the west) and Cagliari (to the south) are alternatives.

The family runs the place with love, and the olive oil, fruit, vegetables and Cannonau wine that appear at mealtimes are home produced.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Boating the Blue Crescent\n\nIf you do just one thing, make it a boat trip along the southern Golfo di Orosei, where each cliff-flanked beachette - Cala Luna, Cala Sisine, Cala Biriola, Cala Mariolu - is more gorgeous than the last, their waters fading from aquamarine to sapphire to deep purple.\n\n## Visiting the Grotta di Ispinigoli\n\nImagine the surprise of the shepherd who stumbled across this whopper of a cave in 1950. Just north of Dorgali, descend 60m into the grotto's giant well to glimpse a forest of petrified pinnacles and the world's second-tallest stalagmite (38m).\n\n## What to spot...\n\nFragrant macchia (Mediterranean scrub) fringes the coast, holm oak, juniper and pine the interior. Park residents include Sardinian wildcats, foxes, hares, mouflon, griffon vultures, golden eagles and peregrine falcons.\n\nGREATER WHITE-TOOTHED SHREW This mouse-like shrew loves Sardinia's Mediterranean climate and hides out in grassland and woodland. It's pretty vocal, using high-pitched echolocation to find its way.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nHike vertiginous trails, detour to Bronze Age wonders and lap up the gulf's coastal beauty.\n\n## One week\n\nBegin with a head-spinning drive on the SS125, starting in Orosei - once a Pisan port, now notable for its historic core and beaches. Push south, detouring into farmland to eye Bronze Age Nuraghic sites like Serra Orrios and tombe dei giganti ('giants' tombs'; mass graves) like S'Ena 'e Thomes. The road becomes increasingly spectacular as you approach Dorgali, with its backdrop of limestone peaks and the Grotta di Ispinigoli, where the world's second-biggest stalagmite sprouts. Prettily arranged around a bay, Cala Gonone is a terrific base for hiking, climbing and water sports. From here, visit Cala Fuili, Cala Luna and other gasp-\n\neliciting bays, putter along the Blue Crescent by boat, or hike to the wild Gola Su Gorropu canyon and Tiscali, an enigmatic archaeological site in a collapsed cave. The final, spectacular drive south takes you to Baunei, where old mule trails wriggle down from the other-worldly Golgo plateau to knockout Cala Goloritzè.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-95 -->\n\nNORWAY\n\n## Hardangervidda National Park\n\n22\n\nNorway's wild, high-altitude heartland, Hardangervidda ranks among northern Europe's most accessible wilderness areas, with Arctic foxes, wild reindeer and trails across the tundra three highlights among many.\n\nhe high plateau of Hardangervidda that dominates Norway's largest national park has for centuries held Norwegians and other travellers in its thrall. Once an ancient trade route that connected eastern and western Norway, Hardangervidda is now best known for providing a spectacular backdrop to the peerless Oslo-Bergen railway. It is a prelude to the fjords, with impossibly steep cycling and hiking trails, and the Flåmsbana railway line dropping down into the surrounding abyss. At Geilo, high on Hardangervidda, you can almost step off the train and straight onto a ski lift. This version of Hardangervidda's story tells of a land between two worlds, a place to admire as you cross it on your way elsewhere. T\n\nBut Hardangervidda is also a destination in its own right, an expansive tableau of sweeping alpine beauty and horizons that never seem to end. This is big-sky territory, a largely treeless high country of rolling moorlands cast in green or white depending on the season. Summer hiking and crosscountry skiing in winter reward those who devote time to exploring its intriguing topography - its other-worldly remnants of mountains and hills worn inexorably down by glaciers during the last ice age.\n\nFauna is also essential to the Hardangervidda story. The region's highaltitude climate has created an unlikely Arctic outpost: the Arctic fox is a charismatic presence. The fox's snowy-white pelage makes it almost invisible in winter, but it's far less elusive in its brown-black summer coat. You'll also find Norway's largest herd of wild reindeer, and to see them grazing is to return to an older time when great herds of wildlife roamed free all across Norway.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Hardangervidda's weather can be wild and unpredictable, though you can cross by train year-round. Hike in July and August; cross-country skiing is possible during the rest of the year.\n\nGetting there Hardangervidda inhabits the central Norwegian interior between Oslo and Bergen, close to the nearby fjords; Eidfjord and Flåm are accessible gateway towns. Geilo and Myrdal are important stops along the Oslo-Bergen railway.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n3430\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n1721\n\nHighest point: Sandfloegga (m)\n\n7000 Number of wild reindeer\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-96 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Fossli Hotel\n\nThe Fossli is set just back from the precipice of the stunning, 182m-high Vøringfoss, where Hardangervidda begins. The views are stunning and the rooms are a little faded but have character. Owner Erik, whose greatgrandfather built the hotel in the 1890s, is an engaging host with a treasure trove of Hardangervidda stories. The in-house restaurant serves excellent Norwegian dishes, and there's a waffle cafe.\n\n## Finse 1222\n\nThe exceptionally pleasant Finse 1222, right by the train station and partly built out of old trains, has modern rooms, some with outrageous views over lake and glacier. It's also the starting point for many Hardangervidda activities and has a great restaurant.\n\n## Finsehytta\n\nMost budget travellers stay at the staffed DNT hikers' hut, Finsehytta, which has decent dorms, some of which sleep only two or three people, making it great for couples and families. Set three-course meals are also available.\n\n## Do this!\n\nHiking Hardangervidda has outstanding hiking, but such are its altitude and wild weather that you'll have to be quick - hiking is only possible in July and August. Hikes range from day trips to three-day crossings of the plateau, and it's on the latter that you'll best escape the crowds and increase your chances of spotting wildlife. Guided seven-hour glacier walks also take you onto the edge of the ice sheet, an exhilarating world of crevasses and ice caves.\n\nCross-country skiing Ski trails criss-cross the Hardangervidda area. Those around Geilo or Finse are best for those with little experience, while the longer trails out onto Hardangervidda are for experienced skiers only, as conditions change quickly.\n\n## Traversing by train\n\n## For those unable\n\nto hike, much of the best scenery can be enjoyed from the window of your train as it crosses the plateau between Oslo and Bergen. Break up the journey with a steep detour down the Flåmsbana branch line to Flåm.\n\nGetty Images | Time, Life, Enjoy...; trotsche\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Hardangerjøkulen The popular four-hour, 13.7km trek from Finse to the Blåisen glacier tip of Hardangerjøkulen is a stunning walk. Scenes from the planet Hof in The Empire Strikes Back were filmed around the glacier.\n\n02 Vøringfoss to Kinsarvik via Harteigen This three-day hike visits the picturesque mountain of Harteigen and then descends the Monk's Stairway to Kinsarvik.\n\n## 03 Halne to Dyranut via Rauhelleren\n\nTrails lead south off the Rv7 and away from the crowds on this two-day hike. It's one of the best trails for spotting reindeer herds in summer.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-97 -->\n\n## What to spot...\n\nHardangervidda is wonderful wildlife country. Most reindeer are domesticated, so the wild herds here are quite exceptional; Arctic foxes and snowy owls further mark the region out as a refuge for wildlife found this far south nowhere else in Norway. Wooded until perhaps 5000 years ago, Hardangervidda is now eerily treeless. In the east, wild grasses, fungi, lichens and mosses are all that really survive the alpine climate, although Hardangervidda's west can boast a few hardy species of alpine flower.\n\nREINDEER Feeding on lichens, Hardangervidda's reindeer migrate from winter grazing grounds in the east to western breeding grounds in summer. The population is now stable after having blown out to nearly 19,000 in 1998.\n\nARCTIC FOX The extremely adaptable Arctic fox changes colour with the seasons and feeds on everything from lemmings, voles and birds to carrion, fruit and insects. Numbers here are low but growing.\n\nSNOWY OWL This large, handsome owl nests on the ground and hunts small rodents such as lemmings. Males are almost completely white, while females have greyflecked feathers.\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nン\n\nLonely Planet | Justin Foulkes, Getty Images | bennymarty; Gary Cook/robertharding\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-98 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nSuch is Hardangervidda's scale and beauty that you can only do it justice by combining a train (or car) crossing with some hiking.\n\n- ↓ Hotel Finse 1222 is handily placed next to the train station. ↓ Huts provide shelter for hikers from the often harsh weather on Hardangervidda plateau.\n- ↓ Norway's most dramatic waterfall, Vøringfossen, is a major tourist attraction.\n\n## A day\n\nThere can be few more pleasurable travel experiences than journeying between Bergen and Oslo by train, and the high point, literally, of this trip is the hours spent crossing Hardangervidda. So vast is this, Europe's largest mountain plateau, that there's no better way to see it in a short time frame than by train - in considerable comfort. It's also most likely the only way you'll be able to visit in winter. All the way you'll be glued to your window (be sure to reserve a window seat…) as the train\n\n## Two days\n\nWith an extra day, you can break up the journey by staying overnight, preferably at Finse, and add an activity or two to the big-picture impressions you enjoyed on day one. The long summer days mean that there will come a time after the day trippers leave when the silence of Hardangervidda takes hold - always a magical moment. Although you may be tempted by the call of multiday hikes, most visitors find the trip to Hardangerjøkulen to be a memorable sampling climbs onto the plateau and follows the contours of this bare and beautiful land. Numerous trains pass by every day, meaning that it's easy enough to get out in Finse, Geilo or Myrdal, even if it's only to breathe the fresh mountain air. If you make the journey in your own vehicle, that's better still: you'll be able to pull over and enjoy the view whenever you like. Staying at Fossli, on the western side of Hardangervidda, next to Vøringfoss, is a wonderful way to end a glorious day.\n\nof the plateau's beauties, combining a lovely hike with the drama of the permanent ice sheet. Another option is to organise a glacier walk, a vertigo-inspiring experience on many travellers' bucket lists. Still another alternative is to take the Flåmsbana railway from Myrdal down to Flåm and back up onto the plateau an extraordinary window on two very different, very pretty worlds that will put Hardangervidda in an altogether different context - before you continue on your way.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-99 -->\n\nAUSTRIA\n\nHohe Tauern National Park\n\n23\n\nExperience the Austrian Alps at their most elemental in this giant of a national park, with top-of-the-beanstalk views from the Grossglockner Rd that runs through its spectacular heart.\n\nGetty Images | Westend61\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-100 -->\n\nA s you crest a rise on the Pinzgauer Spaziergang, suddenly the view cracks open and there, lining the horizon, is Hohe Tauern's hit parade of three-thousanders, their summits frosted with glaciers. It's hard to tear away your gaze, but you trudge on, past tarns that glint like gemstones and through moors flecked with silky cotton grass that bends in the summer breeze. The ever-narrowing path navigates slopes streaked with the moraine of a thousand avalanches, skims glass-clear streams and wriggles up to a saddle where an ibex surveys you from its rocky outpost. As day slips into dusk, shadows creep across the mountains, sharpening contours into relief. Beyond, the summit of Grossglockner, Austria's highest peak, glows in the fading light. Alpenglühen , it's called.\n\nAfter the last ice age, Hohe Tauern was but a rock-and-scree wasteland. Then animals arrived from the steppes of Central Asia, the Arctic and the Siberian tundra as temperatures rose and glaciers retreated. Ten millennia later, the Romans made it the dividing line between their southern territories and northern conquests. A trade route for pack animals ran along the pass at the end of the Tauern Valley. But people were mistrustful of settling in this raw wilderness - tales of malevolent ice spirits were rife.\n\nIf Mother Nature surpassed herself in the Alps, Hohe Tauern is her magnum opus. Every bend on the Grossglockner Rd offers thrilling new perspectives: glaciers spilling down wrinkled mountainsides, meadows gilded with arnica and crowfoot, Heiligenblut pilgrimage church lifted above a valley as though cupped in celestial\n\nhands. This is scenery that makes you want to yodel aloud - or at the very least grab your boots, jump in a saddle or climb to an above-the-clouds crag where you feel, if only for an instant, like a speck on the face of the planet.\n\n↓ The awe-inspiring Krimml Falls is Europe's highest waterfall, dropping 380m.

The Senger family make you feel instantly at home in the chalet's woodsy nooks and firewarmed crannies. Breakfasts and dinners are generous, and there's also a flowery garden, a sauna and a hammam.\n\nthe fringes of the national park, this 310km trail is not technically difficult but requires stamina. Beginning in Krimml, it heads downstream to Salzburg and Passau. Even cycling a short section of it is unforgettable.\n\n## Climbing Grossglockner\n\nFor mountaineers, the ascent of Grossglockner is oncein-a-lifetime stuff. Anyone with experience can climb it via the 'normal' path, a two-hour route that begins at Erzog-JohannHütte, traverses rock and ice, and then follows a steel cable up a snowy ridge. Guides are available in Heiligenblut.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nHohe Tauern National Park is high-Alpine country, with heavy snowfalls in winter. Forests of pine, spruce and larch fringe meadows dappled with gentians, arnica, Alpine rhododendrons and edelweiss. These rise to moors riddled with marmot holes and in turn to bald, glacier-encrusted peaks of granite. Dawn and dusk are best for sighting chamois and ibex, while birds of prey such as bearded and griffon vultures, falcons and golden eagles can often be seen wheeling in the skies overhead.\n\nGRIFFON VULTURE Hohe Tauern offers the best chance in the Alps of spotting these sociable, white-headed vultures. Up to 50 flock here between May and September, resting at the same roosts each year.\n\nSAXIFRAGA RUDOLPHIANA These fivepetalled, pink-purple blooms cling to mossy beds in the half-shade of rocks and gorges.

Detour on a side road up to the highest lookout,\n\n## Three days\n\nFollow the day itinerary and devote extra time to Heiligenblut. One of Hohe Tauern's most striking sights is the needle of its 15th-century pilgrimage church framed by Grossglockner's snowy hump. Inside is a tabernacle that purportedly contains a tiny phial of Christ's blood, hence the name Heiligenblut ('Holy Blood'). Mountaineers use this postcard-pretty village as a base for bagging peaks in the national park.\n\nBack in Zell am See, walk or cycle the mountain-\n\n## A week\n\nWith a week on your hands, you can take a walk on the park's wild side by hooking onto one of the guided ranger hikes (July to September), stretching from glacier treks to wildlife-spotting walks. If climbing is more your bag, scramble up Grossglockner from Heiligenblut or the perennially ice-capped Grossvenediger (3674m) from Matreier Tauernhaus.\n\nHiking and climbing are, however, just tip-ofthe-iceberg stuff. Outdoor activities abound in Hohe Tauern, with Zell am See facing promenade, hire a pedalo or go for a skin-tingling dip in the lake itself, peering up at Grossglockner and co. As the sun dips behind the mountaintops, head to Steinerwirt for a gutsy goulash with dumplings.\n\nYou'll be itching to get out and stride in those mountains by your third day and Zell is a terrific base, with walks ranging from gentle ambles through Alpine pastures tinkling with cowbells to highaltitude day hikes like the Pinzgauer Spaziergang.\n\na central base. Besides glacier skiing 10 months of the year atop Kitzsteinhorn, you could up the adventure quotient with whitewater rafting, canyoning, waterskiing, wakeboarding or tandem paragliding.\n\nFactor in a day trip, too, to the thunderous Krimml Falls. Europe's highest waterfall at 380m, it crashes over three tiers in billowing clouds of mist and is arched by a rainbow when sunlight rakes through the mixed forest that skirts it.

He spurs his steed into a brisk canter across wide open plains. These vast prairies carry more than a whisper of the wild, wild West. But the puszta - the flat grasslands and marshes of Hortobágy National Park - stir the Hungarian soul. They are the bedrock of this country's agrarian history. A\n\nThe national park is part of the Great Hungarian Plain, which rolls across the eastern half of the country. This was once the homeland of csikósok , skilled herdsmen who thundered across the prairies. Pastoral lifestyles of lapsed centuries are frozen in time in Hortobágy: traditional sweep-pole wells dot its meadows, while herdsmen's inns retain their original character. And while the csikós ' lifestyle has faded away, his descendants remain, many of them still learning horse-riding arts.\n\nThese plains hold remainders of kurgans (burial mounds), suggesting that nomads passed through as long ago as 2000 BC. More established settlements came to Hortobágy from the 9th century, although a more tangible history dates to Hortobágy's cowboy heyday, in particular its 18th- and 19th-century stone bridges and travellers' lodgings.\n\nAt first glance, Hortobágy's patchwork of alkaline pastures, meadows and wetlands has a mesmerising uniformity. And somewhere between tramping through meadows and watching cranes alight by lagoons, the puszta works its magic. These prairies extend towards a dusty horizon where conditions are ripe for Fata Morgana mirages: optical illusions that distort and invert distant images. So, as the sun begins to dip, washing the fields of ryegrass in gold, don't be surprised if you seem to spot an 18th-century horseman out of the corner of your eye…\n\n- ↓ Endangered Przewalski's horses.\n- ↓ Bearded reedling.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The season for safaris and family-friendly activities is April to October. Outside these months, museums close, though the visitor centre stays open. Wildlife watchers should visit during crane-migration season (late September and October).\n\nGetting there Hortobágy village is a natural starting point. It's 40km west of Debrecen, Hungary's elegant second city, and easily accessible by bus or car via Rte 33. Debrecen's airport has links to numerous European destinations.

Reward a day of windswept walks by slipping into a steamy soak at this spa hotel on the park's eastern edge. Thermal waters are tinged the colour of tea, thanks to a reputedly muscle-soothing cocktail of minerals.\n\n## Ökotúra Camping\n\nWith this pleasant campground as your base, you can sleep under starry skies, awaken to the sound of whistling great bustards and attach yourself to plenty of guided excursions into the park. There's a simple guesthouse if canvas isn't your thing.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Going on a puszta safari\n\nThe most enriching way to explore the bare heart of the puszta is with a knowledgeable guide aboard a Land Rover safari tour. You can access breathtaking views and spy on star residents like white-tailed eagles and wild horses.\n\n## Stargazing\n\nLight restrictions and a low population ensure heavenly conditions for budding astronomers in Hortobágy, which has been recognised with silver-tier Dark Sky status. Sign up for a stargazing walk organised by park authorities or simply bring a telescope and dream of galaxies far away.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nFarm animals like long-horned grey cattle and Goldilockstressed Mangalica pigs are Hortobágy icons. Przewalski's horses kick up dust, and 300 bird species can be spotted.\n\nGREAT BUSTARD Recognisable by its pale-grey head and stripy russet feathers, the bustard is one of the world's heaviest flying birds. We mean it as a compliment: the heftiest one recorded tipped the scales at 21kg.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nSummon your inner cowboy for a weekend of buffalo spotting and roaming wide open plains.\n\n## A weekend\n\nSteep yourself in the lore of the wild east at Hortobágy Herdsmen Museum, before nourishing yourself like a true csikós at 300-year-old Hortobágy Big Inn nearby. From here, trundle by horsedrawn carriage to Máta Stud Farm to eye up Hungary's distinctive woolly pigs and shaggy Racka sheep before witnessing an astonishing\n\ndisplay of traditional horsemanship by csikósok descendants. Horsemen can command their steeds to lie perfectly flat - once an essential defence from livestock rustlers - and some have mastered the ' puszta five' , where a single horseman stands astride five galloping horses.\n\nOn day two, start with a safari across the sweeping plains; bring binoculars for a close look at buffalo and prancing Przewalski's horses. Spend the afternoon exploring on foot: if you're travelling with kids, they'll adore the narrow-gauge railway to Hortobágy Fishponds, a teeming wetland threaded with footpaths.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-106 -->\n\nGetty Images | Global\\_Pics\n\n## Jostedalsbreen National Park\n\nBuilt around mainland Europe's largest glacier, Norway's drama-filled Jostedalsbreen National Park combines sheer rock walls and groaning rivers of ice within sight of the fjords.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-107 -->\n\nO ne moment you're following a sinuous, fjord-hugging road that snakes across Norway's west, the next you round a corner and find yourself face to face with one of the most extraordinary sights anywhere in Europe. Mighty Jostedalsbreen is the glacier you always dreamed of - vast in scale, magical in its ice-blue beauty, and seemingly alive as it groans and inches its way like a scythe through high mountain valleys and down to the water.\n\nThe massive ice sheet feeds numerous glacier tongues that descend to the water's edge, shaping this vertiginous world as they ebb and flow, advance and retreat. For years, Jostedalsbreen bucked the worldwide trend and actually grew in size, but sadly even this contrarian glacier has been pulled back into shape by the vagaries of global warming, and recent years have seen the glaciers here shrink markedly. With an area of more than 800 sq km and an ice sheet up to 600m thick, though, Jostedalsbreen and its offshoots remain a remarkable, compelling, irresistible force of nature. To see what we mean, watch for the remnants of farms destroyed by the glaciers' march in 1750.\n\nWildlife is less of a feature in this park than elsewhere in Norway, not so much because it's not there but rather because much of the park is inaccessible to ordinary visitors; brown bear, elk and red deer inhabit the few areas of the park not covered in ice. But it's the glaciers themselves - Nigardsbreen, Briksdalsbreen, Bødalsbreen, Bøyabreen and Supphellebreen are among those that are considered part of the wider Jostedalsbreen ice sheet and fall partly within the park's boundaries - that are the most impressive elements of this magnificent place.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go While the roads of the region usually remain open year-round, most operators that offer glacier experiences close from October to April. The best time to visit is from midJune to late August.\n\nGetting there Jostedalsbreen is in the heart of the fjord country of central Norway, close to the towns of Fjærland and Stryn, and around halfway between the most popular fjords of Geiranger and Sognefjorden.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n1310\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n2083\n\nHighest point: Lodalskåpa (m)\n\n400,000\n\nRock eroded by glacier annually (tonnes)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-108 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Hotel Mundal x\n\nRetaining much of its period furniture and run by the same family ever since it was built in 1891, Hotel Mundal in Fjærland, a main gateway town to Jostedalsbreen, features a welcoming lounge and a lovely round tower. You can even sleep the night in the tower's one room with wraparound views - as did US expresident Walter Mondale, whose family came from Mundal. The restaurant serves truly wonderful traditional Norwegian dinners.\n\n## Jostedal Hotel\n\nIn the Jostedal Valley near Nigardsbreen, this friendly place\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Glacier walking\n\nThere's a real cachet about walking atop a glacier, and numerous operators in the area surrounding Jostedalsbreen run expertly guided explorations onto the ice sheet. The shortest walks spend an hour on the ice, but up to five hours is also possible. This is not your usual stroll - expect crampons and ropes and plenty of time spent staring into a bottomless abyss. Standard hikes are also available\n\nKayaking Many of the glacier tongues end their descent at the water's edge, so the easiest way to get close has been run by the same family for three generations; much of what appears on the restaurant menu comes from their farm. In addition to standard rooms, there's a handful of five-person family rooms.\n\n## Jostedal Camping\n\nThis trim, well-kept campground sits right beside the Jostedal River. It has hiking information, the owners are friendly, facilities are impeccable and there's a lovely riverside terrace. Britain's Prince William once stayed here on a university field trip.\n\nis out on the water. Kayaking up to the more isolated spots is a soulful experience - outfitter Ice Troll is the pick when it comes to escaping crowds and motorboats.\n\n## Rafting\n\nMoving at an anythingbut-glacial pace, the Jostedal River, fed by the high glaciers of Jostedalsbreen, is for those looking for an adrenaline rush to go with their quiet contemplation of the ice sheet.\n\n↓ Dramatic Nigardsbreen glacier is an arm of the greater Jostedalsbreen glacier. Previous page: Briksdalsbreen glacier, popular with hikers.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nYou may not come here for the wildlife, but the park shelters some pretty impressive creatures, among them brown bears, elk, red deer, foxes, hares and squirrels. The area also has the highest density of bird species in western Norway, with the most variety in summer, when migratory species return from Africa.\n\nStands of alder, birch and pine increasingly carpet the open ground close to the water's edge, with heathers, ferns, mosses and flowering plants moving in as glaciers retreat.\n\nEURASIAN BROWN BEAR Spot a brown bear in Jostedalsbreen and you've hit the jackpot.\n\nNorway's bears can weigh up to 300kg; although they were once primarily carnivores, meat now makes up as little as 10 percent of their diet.\n\nELK (MOOSE) The elk ( elg in Norwegian) is common in Norway and the largest extant species of deer. Fully grown males have extravagant antlers.\n\nRED DEER Another large deer species, red deer can be seen in big groups led by a single male; when another male seeks to take over the group, the clash of antlers can be heard from kilometres away.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-109 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Nigardsbreen A boat trip across Nigardsvatnet lake takes you to the trailhead for this glacier, where one- to fivehour guided glacier walks are possible.\n\n## 02 Kjenndalsbreen and Bødalsbreen\n\nLess a single hike than a whole valley of possibilities, the little-visited Kjenndalsbreen glacier tongue is good for five-hour glacier hikes or valley walks in adjacent Bødalsbreen.\n\n03 Briksdalsbreen This glacier was popular for glacier hikes until splintering made it unsafe, but that may change. On dry land, it's a lovely, if steep, 5km-return hike up to the glacier face from where the road ends.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-110 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nExploring Jostedalsbreen means finding a base or two from which to launch daily forays into the park, although there is one overnight option for the adventurous.\n\n- ↓ Ice-axes and crampons are mandatory for glacier walks on Nigardsbreen.\n- ↓ The Breheimsenteret Glacier Centre at Nigardsbreen.\n\njourney through the world of glaciers. Follow this up with a trip to the glacier tongue of Supphellebreen, where you can walk right up and touch the ice; ice blocks from here were used as podiums at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. At blue, creaking, more-spectacular Bøyabreen over the hill, you might happen upon glacial calving as a hunk tumbles into the meltwater lagoon beneath the glacier tongue. If you've left enough time, organise a short glacier walk with one of the numerous operators in the area.\n\n## A day\n\nA day spent in the vicinity of Jostedalsbreen goes something like this. Base yourself in Fjærland (which is accessible from Sognefjorden and other towns of the western fjords by regular ferry services) and browse the bookshops of this world-famous book town. Then learn everything there is to learn at the town's excellent Norwegian Glacier Museum. Thoughtfully conceived exhibits explain how fjords are formed (by glaciers, of course), let you touch 1000-year-old ice, and take you on a terrific video\n\n## Two days\n\nYou could continue on from where you left off on day one by taking a longer glacier walk (up to five hours' duration is possible, depending on the glacier) and in the process take in some of the other glaciers in the area. Nigardsbreen is accessible, spectacular and perfect for a different slant on glacier life, although it can get busy at the height of summer. You could even take a guided kayaking trip out onto the fjord and into the shadow of the glacier where it meets the water. For something truly\n\n## Three days\n\nFjords are very much a part of the Jostedalsbreen experience - it was, after all, glacial ice in vast quantities, down through the ages, that carved the fjords - and Stryn, north of Jostedalsbreen, is a fabulous base for both glaciers and the western fjords; Geirangerfjord in particular is not far away. Wherever you slept on the night of day one, spend your second night in Stryn, an appealing little town in its own right. To complete your set of Jostedalsbreen glaciers and glacier tongues, add Kjenndalsbreen unforgettable, consider Ice Troll's overnight kayak-andhike expedition - you'll kayak to a shoreline within sight of a glacier and, with the crowds far away, hike along the shore and up onto the glacier under expert guidance. A beautiful campground - is there any other kind in Norway? - is the ideal vantage point for a memorable escape from the world and its noise, with the night-time groans of calving ice a soundtrack you'll never forget, before you kayak back to Fjærland next morning.\n\nand its near neighbour Bødalsbreen to your daythree explorations, and don't miss Briksdalsbreen. It might be one of the most popular glacier day trips, but Briksdalsbreen has an extra attraction: cute little carts or steep trails lead you to the ice, while inflatable dinghies provide another novelty-rich way to approach the glacier. However, your excitement over the mode of transport will not so much wear off as disappear from your mind as you gaze in awe at a glacier so beautiful that it casts everything else into shadow.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-111 -->\n\nNORWAY\n\nJotunheimen National Park\n\n26\n\nCrowning Norway's high country like the ramparts of a lost mountain kingdom, Jotunheimen is a stirring wilderness of jagged peaks, sinuous hiking trails and abundant wildlife.\n\nGetty Images | kiszon pascal\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-112 -->\n\nT he steep, serpentine roads that climb from the fjords to this high mountain realm have the quality of a revelation. The blue of the fjords yields to quiet summer valleys of green, before the drama of ice, snow and rock takes hold. It can be an abrupt change, this journey into and across the roof of Scandinavia - as you crest a rise along one of only a handful of access routes into the park, the sudden panorama of summits is known to prompt in first-time visitors equally sudden exclamations of awe and joy.\n\nNot for nothing is Jotunheimen known as Norway's 'Home of the Giants' - more than 275 of the mountains inside the park rise above 2000m. To put it another way, Jotunheimen is home to every peak in Norway to rise above 2300m. Some of them bear names that evoke the mysteries of Scandinavian sagas, among them Galdhøpiggen (the highest peak in northern Europe), Glittertind and Store Skagastølstind. From the heights, glaciers and countless waterfalls empty into deep ravines and ice-blue lakes far below, deep in mountain shadow.\n\nThe park has long provided inspiration to Norway's storytellers - it was along one of Jotunheimen's high ridges that Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt famously rode a wild reindeer. But humankind's desire to traverse the park has an altogether more prosaic back story. A perilous supply route crossed the area from the 15th century. Much later, the paved road that crosses the park - the extraordinary Sognefjellet Rd (Rv55) that rises to 1434m and is the highest mountain road in northern Europe - was built in 1939 by Norway's unemployed youth.

Its short, intense summer season from June to August is the ideal time to visit and see what the park has to offer, with many of the hiking possibilities following the high ridgelines, offering views that are unrivalled anywhere else in Norway.\n\nWith so much to offer, trails can be crowded - an estimated 30,000 hikers walk the glorious Besseggen route every summer - but the park has many quieter trails that immerse you in the wilderness and open up myriad wildlife-watching possibilities.\n\nand supremely comfortable rooms, but there are also dorm beds, camping and cheaper rooms in the annexe.

The skiing is relatively easy, save for the dangers inherent in taking your eyes off the slopes as you admire the view…\n\n## Driving through\n\nEven if you can't hike, large swathes of Jotunheimen are accessible by road. The Sognefjellet Rd from Lom to Lustrafjorden is one of Europe's most scenic drives, but don't forsake the quieter side roads of Turtagrø to Øvre Årdal or Jotunheimvegen.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nMuch of Jotunheimen lies above the tree line, but mountain birch, mountain pine, black alder, elm and hazel flourish in Bøverdalen and Utladalen. Watch also for ice-age relics such as alpine rock cress, hairy stonecrop and alpine catchfly. With so many visitors in summer, spotting wildlife can be a challenge. Even so, keep an eye out for wild reindeer, elk, foxes, martens, wolverines, Eurasian lynx and roe deer. The park's 75 bird species include the icterine warbler, woodpecker, gyrfalcon and golden eagle.\n\nWOLVERINE Long and lithe, fierce and solitary, the wolverine is a strangely bear-like member of the weasel family and, though elusive, is one of Jotunheimen's peak carnivore species.\n\nGLACIER BUTTERCUP A real mountain specialist, the glacier buttercup is a pretty white-andyellow flower and the king of Norway's alpine slopes, growing close to the summit of Glittertind (2465m), more than 1km above the tree line.\n\nGYRFALCON The largest of the falcon family, the handsome gyrfalcon has a predominantly white coat with black flecks and is best seen soaring high on the thermals watching for prey.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-115 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Galdhøpiggen With dramatic cirques, arêtes and glaciers, this challenging six- to eighthour, 6.2km day hike begins at Spiterstulen where the toll road starts and climbs 1470m to the summit of Norway.\n\n## 02 Besseggen\n\nNorway's most popular hike, this spectacular trail along the Besseggen ridge takes six to eight hours and covers 22.9km, with fabulous views all the way.

The route here is broadly the same as for the one-day itinerary but allows for detours and an overnight stay. Quite early on your ascent through Bøverdalen, take the turnoff to Spiterstulen, park the car at the toll point, and set off on foot for the summit of Galdhøpiggen a six- to eight-hour return hike.

One favourite is Jotunheimvegen, a quiet and magnificent mountain road running 45km from Bygdin to Skåbu. Another is the shorter detour up to the toll point at Øvre Årdal; if you take this road early in the season, you may find yourself driving between deep, deep towers of cleared roadside snow. And then there's the turn-off to Leirvassbu, a remote mountain lodge with wild one of Bøverdalen's many lodges and hotels. The next morning, take the turn-off to Juvasshytta, a lodge set in utterly spectacular country close to Galdhøpiggen's summer ski station.

Behind them rise the brooding Macgillycuddy's Reeks, Ireland's highest mountains, in a dramatic lakeland landscape that has an undeniably romantic allure. In the ancient, twisted forests that surround the lakes, a thick, velvety carpet of moss covers the ground and drips from the trees, giving these woods a mysterious, enchanted air.\n\nIt's the kind of place a hobbit or a hermit might well appear and, indeed, human history is an intrinsic part of the park, with the devout, the outcast, the artistic and the wealthy all leaving their mark here. Bronze Age copper miners were the first to arrive, followed in the 7th century by St Finian, who founded a leper colony and monastery on Innisfallen Island, where the monks lived for 850 years and reputedly educated the high kings of Ireland. If you're lucky, you'll spot Ireland's only herd of native red deer swimming to the island to graze among the ancient ruins.\n\nThe impressive landscapes lured the nobility, too, with the imposing bulk of medieval Ross Castle lording over Lough Leane and defiantly asserting its position across the lake from elaborate Muckross House, a Tudor-style mansion that played host to Queen Victoria in 1861. The house and its vast estate, which forms the core of the park, was presented to the state in 1932.\n\nSince then the park has become one of the most popular, and commercialised, in the country, and in midsummer you'd do well to escape the shamrock-festooned souvenirs and well-trodden paths and retreat instead into the hills, to escape\n\n↓ The verdant cascades of Torc Waterfall are a local landmark.

Muckross House gardens and the invasive but beautiful rhododendrons are most colourful from April to June; the deer rut dramatically in October and November.\n\n## Getting there\n\nThe park sits on the edge of Killarney town in southwestern Ireland; the nearest airport is 16km north at Farranfore.

Bag a room in the original house if possible and enjoy its old-world charm, antique furniture, crystal chandeliers and heavy drapes. Service is impeccable, and in autumn the hotel is one of the best places in the park to watch and hear stags roaring and rutting.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Sunset kayaking\n\nAs the sun sets, hop in a kayak and paddle silently into the inky depths of the Killarney lakes. About a quarter of the park is covered by water, and as night begins to fall over the woods you'll see swans bedding down for the evening, and possibly spot red deer swimming across the lakes or brown trout jumping from the water.

The Gulf Stream offers a blanket of warmth, allowing plants and animals from southern Europe to thrive here. You'll see sika deer as well as native red deer, and a wealth of birdlife including the reintroduced white-tailed eagle.\n\nRED DEER Ireland's largest deer are found in the wild only in this park. They have a deep red colour in summer, and the males' large antlers are put to dramatic use during the autumn rut.\n\nARBUTUS More typically seen around the Mediterranean, the arbutus (strawberry tree) has distinctive clusters of red or yellow spiky fruit and masses of white flowers that bloom in November and December.\n\nKILLARNEY SHAD A critically endangered species endemic to Lough Leane, this member of the herring family, known locally as the goureen, was trapped in the lake about 16,000 years ago.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-120 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Muckross Lake Loop Explore the lakeside woods and parklands on this flat 15km trail around Muckross Lake, discovering rocky coves and the ancient yews of Reenadinna Wood.\n\n02 Torc Mountain A relatively easy 6km hill walk on maintained trails, Torc Mountain offers stunning views over the Killarney Valley, Mangerton and the Macgillycuddy's Reeks.\n\n03 Mangerton Mountain Make your way to the top of the park's highest peak on this challenging 10km hike on open hillsides.

The first stop is the atmospheric ruins of Muckross Abbey, a well-preserved 15th-century friary, and then you can continue on to Muckross House to explore its oldworld rooms and discover what life was like for the wealthy Victorian elite. Make your way further along the lake shore, possibly adding in a 4km loop to Torc downhill to Kate Kearney's Cottage to enjoy a wellearned drink or snack and then an easy ride along a new cycle path back into Killarney town. If you'd prefer not to cycle you can take a jaunting car or walk along the Gap and take a coach back to town.\n\nWaterfall, a gushing cascade that tumbles over rocks in a magical forest blanketed in moss. Once you're back on the main trail, head for Old Weir Bridge and 200-yearold Dinis Cottage, where early graffiti on the windows was carved by visiting honeymooners.\n\nThen it's time to return along the Muckross peninsula, stopping to walk through Reenadinna Wood, one of only three remaining yew forests in Europe, before coming back to town. On day three, escape the crowds and retreat into the hills with a hike up Mangerton Mountain. The hike begins along a dry riverbed and as you gradually gain height the lakes are revealed below you in spectacular fashion. You'll pass the beautiful Devil's Punch Bowl, a gorgeous glacial lake, and then head along a precipitous ridge to the summit, where the park and the neighbouring Macgillycuddy's Reeks stretch out before you, offering a sense of real wilderness in what can feel like a very busy park.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-122 -->\n\n## Kornati Islands National Park\n\n28 CROATIA\n\nCroatia's 89 jagged Kornati Islands float on the Adriatic like splashes of mercury, their moon-like surfaces covered with low ochre grasses and silvery sage.\n\nhere's a sense of floating into another world when you first catch sight of the Kornati archipelago. Sailing around the Mediterranean's densest collection of islands is an exercise in silence and bareness; mostly devoid of visible life, the islands' surface is speckled with wild herbs and low scrub. The karst rock, shaped by the elements, takes jagged, unruly forms, with steep cliffs, shadowy caves and arid, sun-drenched flatness. Lizards and butterflies slither and flutter. This stillness of the land has made it possible for the local marine life to remain relatively undisturbed - the waters of the Adriatic hide a thriving ecosystem in their depths. Scuba diving here offers a glimpse of a plenitude of life that was once at least partially matched by that of the islands' terrain. T\n\nThe archipelago was covered in forest during times of Venetian occupation, when the Zadar aristocracy allowed the peasants of Murter to produce cheese and olive oil on the islands in return for some of the produce. Thus the existing greenery was burned down several times to make pasture for sheep and goats, leaving the island as barren as it is today. The remains of Roman villas on the island of Kornat, and the evidence of archaeological digs, indicate that there was once a vibrant Roman settlement here. In the Middle Ages the islands were used for fishing, stone quarries, and Venetian storage and military supplies. Even though Kornat has around 50 houses, the islanders mostly live in Murter now, moving back only in summer months.\n\nThe archipelago has been a national park since 1980, and the relative inaccessibility of the islands has made them a preferred destination of private yacht owners, who are catered to by local fishermen in exclusive cove restaurants.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The islands are at their best in early and late summer. The high summer season is hot and crowded with tour boats. Sailing with a private yacht is more flexible.\n\n## Getting there The islands are\n\nsouth of Zadar (the nearest airport). Kornat, 35km long and 2km wide, is the main and largest island; Piškera and Žut have yachting marinas. You can visit the park on a boat tour, or rent a yacht (or bring your own).\n\nPark in numbers\n\n320\n\nSea area covered (sq km)\n\nVarieties of butterfly\n\n69\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-123 -->\n\n## Do this...\n\n01 Diving Head underwater to discover the islands' wondrous sea life, such as multicoloured fish, corals, crustaceans and sponges.\n\n02 Exploring underwater cliffs sea level.

You have to enjoy simplicity to stay here, because the facilities are minimal: you get rainwater in a tank for your water supply, solar energy runs your light, and your shower water is heated by the sunshine. It's an absolute treat for lovers of the outdoors.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Boat cruises\n\nThe best way to get to know the islands is by boat. Renting a boat and skipper means you can decide on your own itinerary and stop where and when you please. You can also go on an all-day cruise with a group.\n\n## Diving\n\nExploring the archipelago's rich marine life is a real treat: you'll be able to see caves, wrecks, red coral, octopuses, crustaceans, sea slugs and brightly coloured fish. Kornat island has agencies that organise dives inside the park.\n\n↓ Boats ply the cerulean waters of Kornati Islands National Park.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park enjoys a mild climate. Its fauna includes the Dalmatian wall lizard, the brush-footed butterfly and the yellow-legged gull.\n\nDALMATIAN WALL LIZARD This yellow, orange and white lizard, endemic to the region, enjoys shrubby vegetation, rocky areas and pastureland. It's easily spotted slithering in and out of the karst rocks on hot summer days.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nGo sailing around the islands and dive into the clear waters of the Adriatic.\n\n## A day\n\nThe best of Kornati National Park is to be had by hiring a boat and skipper so that you can explore the islands at your own pace; failing that, a day-long boat tour will cover the main islands. Start by seeing the karst rock formations on Kornat, then come ashore for a morning walk around the island (note that the midday heat can make walking quite taxing).\n\nMake arrangements with a diving agency for an afternoon dive here, and in the meantime sail around the archipelago, witnessing some of the tiniest land formations you're likely to see - some of the islands are a mere 0.2 sq km. Swim into remote caves and look at the jagged, whirling rock formations made by water and wind over the past 65 million years. Bathe in the warm, still Adriatic and have lunch on the boat. Head back to Kornat and enjoy a dive or snorkel, taking in the wonderful world below. Don't miss the underwater cliffs.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-124 -->\n\n## Lahemaa National Park\n\n29 ESTONIA\n\nForest paths, bog boardwalks, abandoned beaches and manor-house halls are sprinkled around the 'Land of Bays', the perfect country retreat from Estonia's nearby capital.\n\nmicrocosm of Estonia's natural charms, Lahemaa National Park takes in a stretch of deeply indented coast with several peninsulas and bays, plus 475 sq km of pine-fresh hinterland that harbours forest, lakes, rivers and bogs. Sleepy villages are scattered throughout the park, cosying up to woods and stretching along inlets. Wildlife abounds, from hard-to-spot brown bears and lynx to busy beavers setting up home in rivers; more than 200 types of bird also nest here. The landscape is mostly flat or gently rolling, so physical exertion isn't required to get the most out of the park - in fact, cycling is a delightful way to get around, and gentle walks and refreshing swims are high on visitor agendas. Adding to today's ease and accessibility, cosy guest houses, restored manor houses, remote seaside campgrounds and rustic taverns offer R&amp;R and ample refreshment. A\n\nDon't go thinking it's all about the great outdoors, though. The counterpoint to the natural charms is found in Lahemaa's cultural life, which preserves the estates of longgone Baltic-German aristocrats, celebrates sea-captain legends and displays captivating contemporary work from Estonian artists.\n\nNowadays a main attraction is the water lapping the shores, but from 1945 to 1991 the entire national park's coastline was a military-controlled frontier, with a 2m-high barbed-wire fence ensuring villagers couldn't access the sea. When it was founded in 1971, Lahemaa was the first national park in the Soviet Union. Though protected areas existed before that, authorities believed that the idea of a national park would promote incendiary feelings of nationalism. Canny lobbying (including a reference to an obscure decree signed by Lenin that mentioned national parks as an acceptable form of nature protection) and years of preparation led to eventual permission.\n\n↓ Lahemaa's beautiful bays are perfect for camping.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The bays, beaches and shady trails are magnets in summer (for holidaymakers as well as mosquitoes). Autumn colours glow, especially around the bogs, while in winter Lahemaa is transformed into a wonderland of snowy shores and frozen seas.\n\nGetting there The park's visitor centre at Palmse is 80km east of Tallinn, accessed by highway E20. Lahemaa is best explored by car or bike, as bus connections are limited (although day tours run from the capital).\n\nPark in numbers\n\n725 Area covered (sq km)\n\n50 Mammal species\n\n115 Highest point (m)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-125 -->\n\n## Walk this...\n\n01 Beaver Trail Keep your eyes peeled on this beautiful 1km walkway, which passes beaver dams on the Altja River.

Guests can choose from a handful of rooms, or doss down in the hayloft in summer. Visiting the neighbouring tavern is a must.\n\n## Sagadi Manor\n\nWaking up in the rarefied confines of Sagadi Manor, with its gracious gardens, is a lovely experience. This is one of the park's major estates, now home to a pink-andwhite baroque mansion and museum, and a hostel, hotel and restaurant. The stables have been converted into fresh, comfortable hotel rooms.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Cycling\n\nLahemaa's tree-lined back roads are perfect for cyclists; many accommodation providers have bikes to rent. Cycle between fishing villages, forest paths and manor estates, or head off-road - the best route is the 11.6km Käsmu trail. Starting in idyllic Käsmu (once a village for sea captains, now popular with artists), the trail heads through the forest to the Matsikivi erratic boulder (a large and incongruous rock carried via ancient glacial action), then continues to the tip of the peninsula, down to Lake Käsmu, and pops out back in the village, near the church.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nBrown bears, moose, lynx and wolves lurk in the forests here, but alas, you're unlikely to see them without specialist help.\n\nBEAVER Beavers are known for building dams, canals and lodges (homes), and in most of Lahemaa's water bodies you can observe the handiwork of these industrious builders, with dropped or halfchewed trees and lodges aplenty.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nDrive or cycle between park highlights, from rocky beaches to elegant estates.\n\n## Two days\n\nStart at the park visitor centre at Palmse, then tour the showpiece estate, a remnant of the longvanished Baltic-German aristocracy. Palmse Manor dates from 1720 and is now a museum. From Palmse, swing northeast to Altja for traditional Estonian fare at the uber-rustic Altja Kõrts, then walk it off: first on the\n\n3km circular Altja nature and cultural trail, taking you past fishing shacks and cottages, and then on the forest and beaver trails around Oandu. On day two, the park's peninsulas beckon. Visit pretty Käsmu for its maritime heritage and erratic boulders, and remote Viinistu for its remarkable art museum plus lunch with a sea view. The private art collection here belongs to Jaan Manitski (fun fact: he made his fortune as the business manager for Swedish superstars ABBA). Head back to the highway via the photogenically tumbledown Kolga Manor and make a final leg-stretch at the boardwalk that traverses Viru Bog.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-126 -->\n\n500px | Graham Norton\n\n30 ENGLAND\n\nLake District National Park\n\nBeautiful, dramatic and inescapably English, the Lake District has been Britain's favourite natural playground since Victorian times. Come for hikes, boat trips and poetry in the landscape.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-127 -->\n\nO K, we admit it: the Lake District is every bit as picturesque and dramatic as you've been led to believe. This glorious collection of craggy hills, shimmering lakes and limpid pools has always held a special place in the English heart. Authors and poets waxed lyrical about it. Naturalists combed its hills for rare insects and butterflies. Climbers scrambled up its rocky peaks. Adrenaline junkies set speed records on its otherwise tranquil waters. And industrialists turned their backs on it and built dark satanic mills, kilns and quarries surrounded by its natural splendour.\n\nFounded in 1951, this was one of England's first national parks, and it has consistently been the nation's most popular national park ever since. That means crowds, particularly at the height of summer, when the sombre stone villages are repainted in rainbow colours of Gore-Tex, and walkers form orderly queues in front of every lookout and beauty spot. But fear not - this is a landscape that rewards those who go the extra mile, ford the extra river and climb the extra crag to see the national park as it deserves to be seen: spectacular, silent and serene.\n\nThe landscape here is defined by the lakes - finger-like slivers of silver left behind by retreating glaciers that gouged out the gullies and rucked up the surrounding landscape into soaring ridges. Wastwater and Windermere, the deepest and longest bodies of water in England, have been the focal points for holidaymakers ever since the Kendal and Windermere Railway line was extended here in 1847. Come in summer and the lakes are a Wordsworth poem made real; come in rain, and the landscape becomes brooding, tormented and elemental. So, poetic in personality as well as appearance.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Summer brings the whole world to the Lake District, but the balmy days create perfect conditions for walking fells and mucking about in boats. Spring and autumn swap crowds for soggy conditions, peace and quiet. In winter, the region is at its most inhospitable and spectacular.\n\n## Getting there Flights to\n\nManchester provide easy connections to the railway line from Manchester to Oxenholme, Kendal, Penrith, Carlisle and Windermere.

For the former experience, book one of the six rooms in the Lake House, set in 40 hectares of grounds. For modernism that still respects its surroundings, stay at the hotel itself for spa treatments in cedar-wood lodges and outdoor hot tubs where you can watch the snow fall in winter.\n\n## Randy Pike\n\nA bawdy name hides boutique sensibilities at this eccentric B&amp;B,\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Climbing Scafell Pike\n\nEngland's highest peak may not sound that impressive at 978m, but the summit is an epic vantage point. What appears to be a rounded hill becomes increasingly rocky at the top, and the final stage of the climb is rugged and exposed. The five- to six-hour ascent from Borrowdale is the most popular route, but a map is essential because of the maze of trails and the landmark-obscuring mist that can roll in.\n\n## Splashing around on the lakes\n\nSwallows and Amazons author Arthur Ransome etched boating in the lakes into the national with three designer suites full of found furnishings, designer fabrics and personality. It's stone-skipping distance from Windermere and Ambleside but famously hard to find - all part of the appeal.\n\n## Wastwater YHA\n\nA gorgeous country house at a shoestring price, the Wastwater YHA has an enviable setting in Wastwater Hall, a 19th-century manor basking on the shores of the lake. It proudly advertises the lack of wi-fi and mobile-phone signal.\n\nconsciousness, and Ullswater, Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Windermere are splendid spots for a sail, splash or paddle. Take your pick from rafting, kayaking, waterskiing, sailing, motor-boating, or dry-as-abone steamer cruises.\n\n## Tackling a crag\n\nAlthough most of the GoreTex-clad legions are bound for Scafell Pike, there are shorter routes to the top of the Lake District namely straight up, with ropes and harness, on a spectacular collection of buttresses and crags.\n\n- ↓ Idyllic hiking past Tarn Hows. Previous page: the pretty Blea Tarn.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWith its varied topography, Lake District National Park provides a haven for some of the most threatened species in the British Isles, including Britain's largest surviving population of red squirrels and the critically endangered vendace, Britain's rarest freshwater whitefish. Until recently, the park was also home to England's only golden eagle. Ospreys, red kites and peregrine falcons are doing rather better, as are red deer, migratory ducks and the otters seen slipping into waterways in search of Arctic char.\n\nRED SQUIRREL What's a common old squirrel doing on a list of special species? Well, Britain's indigenous red squirrel is threatened by American interlopers, and it's especially loved in the Lake District because of Beatrix Potter's Squirrel Nutkin.\n\nVENDACE Britain's rarest fish - due to a sadly predictable combination of habitat loss, pollution and foolishly introduced predator species - the vendace now lives only in Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwent Water.\n\nSUNDEW Everyone loves a carnivorous plant! The beads of liquid glistening like dew on the leaves of the sundew are actually a sweet-smelling glue that lures insects close to curling tendrils, where they are enveloped and digested.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-129 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Old Man of Coniston The climb to the summit of this 803m peak is short and sweet at 6km, but it's blessed with the kind of views that inspire hymns.\n\n## 02 Helvellyn\n\nA worthy competitor to Scafell Pike, Helvellyn's twin ridges encircle a still and silent tarn.

Stay the night before on the shores of Windermere, so you can make an early start for a potter around the streets of Bowness-on-Windermere, and then board the steamer for Ambleside. En route, you'll pass a series of classic lake vistas - shore-side manor houses, Victorian follies, mist-cloaked ridges, sheep - before rolling into Ambleside in time for a pub lunch, or more interesting vegetarian fare at Fellini's. Digest while you check out the town church, museum and ruined Roman fort, then head back through Bowness to Windermere and pick up the trail opposite the train station for the hourlong climb to Orrest Head, where views spill over to the neighbouring Langdale Pikes and the Troutbeck valley. On day two, head to the southern end of the lake and make the steep climb to Gummer's How, a 321m hummock with a Viking name and an almost uninterrupted view along the full sinuous length of Windermere. Catch your\n\n## A week\n\nWith a week to play with, there's no need to rush the views. Start down at water level at Bownesson-Windermere, where you can cruise by steamer, paddle under your own steam in a rowing boat or kayak, or go by slow speedboat (thanks to the 10mph speed restriction on the lake). On day two, pick a country house to explore - Blackwell, 2.4km from Bowness, was an aesthetic reaction to the grim functionality of the industrial revolution, built in classic Arts and Crafts breath with a nostalgic steam-train ride on the Lakeside &amp; Haverthwaite Railway, then detour over to Coniston Water to earn your serious Lake District stripes with the steep 803m scramble up the Old Man of Coniston. From the cairn at the summit, frequented by famously tame sheep, the southern reaches of the national park are laid out before you like a topographic model. By way of reward, finish the day with a pint of local ale in Coniston's award-winning Black Bull Inn.\n\nstyle by Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott. Start day three with a bracing walk to one of the Windermere viewpoints, then potter downhill to Dove Cottage, where Wordsworth penned many of his eulogies to the Lake District. Next, strap on your walking boots and head north to Helvellyn to test your head for heights and calf strength on a proper lakes ascent. If you feel really brave, try the vertiginous knife-edge approach along Striding Edge. Reserve day five for Derwent Water and the atmospheric stone circle at Castlerigg, where people have been appreciating the views for nigh on 4000 years. Use days six and seven for more serious Lake District scrambles - take your pick from Scafell Pike, Great Gable or Haystacks, the favourite of Alfred Wainwright, who literally wrote the book on fellwalking in the lakes.

In spring, thousands of birds gather here to mate, and the spectacle of their wooing is a treat.\n\nSummer sees the lake covered with white and yellow water lilies, and the rich underwater life includes carp, bleak and around 45 other fish species. Autumn brings majestic preparations for the mass avian migration, with birds gathering strength for the long journey ahead. You won't forget the sight of Lake Skadar dotted with feathered residents, or the dawn chorus of hundreds of species. Around 50,000 birds are thought to winter in the region.\n\nLake Skadar was part of the ancient Slav kingdom of Zeta, but it came under Ottoman rule following the empire's invasion in the 13th century and remained under Ottoman control for five centuries. Named after the nearby Albanian town of Skadar (Shkodra), the wetlands were a battling ground for dominance between the Slavs and the Ottomans. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Montenegrin royal family established holiday residences in Rijeka Crnojevića, on the shores of the lake. Virpazar, to the south, was the site of the first Montenegrin anti-Fascist uprising in WWII. Today, two thirds of Lake Skadar is in Montenegro and the remaining third is in Albania; it is the largest lake in the Balkans. The area has been a protected national park since 1983, and in late 2011 it was formally nominated for Unesco World Heritage status.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The lake is worth visiting all year. Late spring and early summer are perfect for observing avian love rituals, and autumn is the time of the wondrous mass migrations. High summer is good for diving, and you can birdwatch even in winter.\n\n## Getting there\n\nLake Skadar sits on the border between Albania and Montenegro. The nearest airports are in Dubrovnik (Croatia) and Podgorica (Montenegro), about two hours' drive to the park.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n370-550\n\nArea covered by the lake (sq km)\n\n270\n\nBird species\n\n48 Fish species\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-133 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Villa Miela\n\nA beautiful, elegantly redone traditional stone house, Villa Miela sits on a lush hillside overlooking the green valley and surrounding mountains. The hosts offer a range of activities, from boating to hiking, and they can cater to different needs and abilities. There's the bonus of an outdoor hot tub to relax in at the end of the day. The rooms are simple and stylish, and the grounds are dotted with fig trees. Located in Virpazar, by the shores of the lake, it's a perfect base for exploring the area.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Birdwatching\n\nThere are few places in Europe that appeal to ornithologists and birdwatchers as much as Lake Skadar. Up to 300 species of bird gather here, attracted by the variety of habitats and the vast marshland. Spring, early summer and autumn are ideal, but come prepared with your best binoculars and boots to catch a glimpse of wintering birds. You will have the chance to spot ibises, squacco herons and the rare Dalmatian pelican, as well as grebes, egrets and terns. Bird spotting is done in a boat or a kayak, depending on your preference.\n\n## Virpazar Cave Apartment\n\nA curiosity in the world of accommodation in this area, this little apartment is inside a cave, with exposed cavernous walls, quirky furniture and a spacious communal terrace. It's perfect if you want to add a bit of character to your stay.\n\n## Apartments Jovicevic\n\nLocated in lakeside Rijeka Crnojevića, this place is a mix of the traditional - with exposed-stone walls and wooden beams - and the retro. The views of the lake from the wood-encased terrace are wonderful.\n\n## Lake boating\n\nA Lake Skadar boat tour offers the ultimate combination of the idyllic and the informative - you get an insight into the lake's geology, its bird and underwater life, and the mountains and hills that surround it.\n\n## Kayaking\n\nGet your hands on some oars and kayak your way - in a guided expedition - around the lake. Paddle up close to pelicans and through fields of water lilies, and get plenty of swimming done, either off the kayak or by a beach.\n\n↓ Lake Skadar is home to the large Dalmatian pelican. Previous page: kayaking the waters.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nBird lovers will be in heaven amid Lake Skadar's 270 species, including the Dalmatian pelican, the last of its kind in Europe. The variety of herons and the immense range of migrating birds are a marvel to observe. Freshwater life is abundant, including carp, bleak and 34 native fish species. The bamboo that edges the lake is the natural habitat of many birds, and the marshes are rich in white and yellow water lilies.\n\n## DALMATIAN PELICAN\n\nThe largest and heaviest of all pelicans also has the widest recorded wingspan. You can spot it by its curly back feathers, grey legs and silvery-white plumage. Adolescents are grey.\n\nCARP This vulnerable species is red, with a protruding mouth, and can weigh up to 14kg. It feeds on vegetation and crustaceans, and it is known to leap out of the water when frightened.\n\nBLEAK Measuring around 25cm in length, the bleak can be spotted by its shiny silver colour and upturned mouth. It moves in large schools and prefers open waters.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-134 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Vranjina trail This one-hour hike ascends Vranjina mountain from the eponymous village, via the 15th-century Vranjina monastery.

If you opt for a boat tour, you'll be able to spot a good range of fish and birds (among them the rare and mighty Dalmatian pelican), take in the sight of ancient Orthodox monasteries set atop tiny islands, see Albanian mountains off in the distance and swim in the lake's deep end. Stop at the restored 14th-century Kom Monastery and gaze at its original frescoes. Bring your own lunch for kayaking around the lake, though some operators can arrange for freshly caught fish to be prepared on one of the small islands - a real treat. You'll have the chance to paddle through swathes of white and yellow water lilies or glide down the unbroken surface of the lake, approaching islands that are used as avian resting grounds. The silence of the kayaks affords a closer look at\n\n## Two days\n\nGetting an aerial perspective of Lake Skadar National Park is best done on a hike to one of the surrounding mountain tops - but be sure to bring plenty of sunscreen and a hat in the summer, plus good walking shoes. There are several hikes to choose from, but none extend for more than six hours in total, and you can deviate from some of the routes on the way down to get some swimming in. Most hikes start from Rijeka Crnojevića or Virpazar. Choosing from one of the pelicans and other birds, and if you're lucky you might spot a carp leaping out of the water. Swimming in the lake is the ideal way to cool down, so make sure you get a few dips in before you head back to shore. Great beaches on the lake include Murići beach and the secluded Pješačac beach. Catching the sunset while still out on the water is an experience you're unlikely to forget.\n\ncouple of circular trails is a good way to go. One such trail takes you up to Obod Cave, offering a fantastic look at some underground life, including a variety of bats and insects, and a chance to enjoy a divine swim in the rock pools; you'll see a 14th-century printing press, one of the first in the region, on the way. The second circular trail goes over Mount Sutorman to the medieval village of Upper Godinje. On the way down to Virpazar, be sure to have a swim at Pješačac beach.\n\nA hike through Walnut Valley is beautifully shady, and there are several natural spring-water pools and waterfalls to swim in along the way; these are also perfect places to stop for a picnic lunch. Possibly the toughest hike takes you up to the summit of Rumija mountain, which sits between Skadar Lake and the Adriatic - the effort of the journey up is repaid with splendid views.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-136 -->\n\nFINLAND\n\n## Lemmenjoki National Park\n\nA candidate for the continent's biggest expanse of uninhabited nothingness, Finland's Lemmenjoki National Park tucks a startling array of culture into the folds of its forests, bogs and bald fells.\n\nold in them hills? No, it's in the low, rolling fells of utterly removed Lemmenjoki, Finland's largest national park, fanning above the Arctic Circle up to the border with Norway. This was traditionally a land for rough, tough loners: the odd prospector, or scatterings of the nation's indigenous tribespeople, the Sámi. G\n\nThe few visitors who venture this far north find a region where gold glistens not solely below the surface. Summer visitors encounter gold above ground in the veins of sharp, perpetual light bathing the river valleys and the marshy, forested fell country behind them, while winter park-goers witness the colour transposed upon the heavens when some of the world's most dazzling northern lights flit phantasmally above.\n\nThis is perhaps the continent's greatest tract of roadless wilderness: old-growth forests, bogs and bare hilltops bisected by snaking tributaries. Yet, incredibly,\n\nLemmenjoki's natural beauty might not be its main allure: the human history here is equally compelling. Rare remnants of Finland's ancient past, in the area's reindeer-farming legacy, as well as in the traditional Sámi communities surviving hereabouts mean the cultural clout is mighty indeed.\n\nThe most inviting inroad into Lemmenjoki's heart is by water. Voyaging by boat along the Lemmenjoki River ushers you up to the rushing, tumbling park highlight, the Ravadasköngäs waterfall, and beyond, into the core of this area. The trip is dipped in a majesty that the vistas from the trails seldom rival. But even a boatload is a crowd up here. So don your hiking boots you must in order to take to the park's myriad pathways and appreciate the true solitude of this place in the same way the park's other famed loner Lemmenjoki's emblem, the wolverine - does.\n\n↓ The spectral sight of the northern lights.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Snow on the ground eight months of the year means a short window for enjoying everything. For cross-country skiing April is best; for hiking, September, when it's usually snow-free and full of radiant autumn colours.\n\nGetting there Ivalo airport, with several daily connections to Helsinki, sits 49km southeast of Inari, which is connected to Finland's northern railway terminus (Rovaniemi) by bus.

There are a couple of restaurants (one Lappish) and no shortage of saunas and wilderness excursions.\n\n## Lapinpirtti\n\nJust 50m from the banks of the Lemmenjoki River near Njurkulahti, this lovely ruddy-coloured self-catering cabin sleeps just one to six people but comes bedecked in traditional Lappish style - with its own rowing boat for guests' use.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Boating\n\nAlong the 22km-long Lemmenjoki River Valley, the section between Njurkulahti and Kultasatama, regular boats connect the park entrance with thunderous Ravadasköngäs falls and beyond. For wilder water-based explorations, kayaks can be rented in Njurkulahti. A sublime two- to three-day canoe route runs to Lake Paadarjärvi.\n\n## Historic sightseeing\n\nLapland's most important ancient cultural sights lie within Lemmenjoki. The region was crucial for reindeer herding, and the ancient pitfall traps used to catch the beasts until the 1800s, as well as the Sallivaara round-up site, offer glimpses of this heritage.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nLemmenjoki's contrasting fell-and-forest landscape ensures high avian diversity: 29 of Europe's endangered birds are found here.\n\nWOLVERINE Park emblem the wolverine is a distinctive long-tailed mustelid the size of a medium dog, with long, chestnut fur protecting it from Lemmenjoki's sub-zero temperatures. It's hard to spot but easier to smell: the unpleasant odour it projects gives it the nickname 'skunk-bear'.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nBegin with a mesmerising boat trip to waterfalls and historic sites, then hike the park's most picturesque fell.\n\n## Two days\n\nOvernight at the most wellappointed accommodation hereabouts, Hotel Korpikartano in Menesjärvi. Fill up on hearty Lappish food, sweat in the sauna and soak in the hot tub before driving the 15km to the park entrance, Njurkulahti, next morning. Stock up on picnic supplies, then take the boat out to the\n\nRavadasköngäs falls. The largest of the Lemmenjoki River tributaries flurries into a tumult, plummeting 10m down a rocky gorge, and there are tranquil spots for picnicking as well as several hiking trails. Continue to the end of the boating route at Kultasatama, where riveting insights into the region's gold-digging history await.\n\nThe next day, try the park's classic leg-stretcher, starting in Njurkulahti and clambering to one of Lemmenjoki's iconic fells, Joenkielinen. The views from here show off some of the most splendid parts of the park just 9km from the entrance and, on the return route, track a particularly gorgeous swathe of the Lemmenjoki River.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-138 -->\n\nGetty Images | David C Tomlinson\n\nLoch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park\n\nWoods and water, hills and heather, highlands and islands - the bonnie banks and braes of Loch Lomond epitomise the best of Scottish scenery.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-139 -->\n\nT he only sound is the gentle splash of your paddle as it slices the water, propelling your canoe the last few metres before the bow crunches ashore on the island's gravel beach.

Just to its east lie the Trossachs (from the Gaelic Na Trosaichean , meaning 'rough terrain'), a scenic mix of lakes, forests and rocky hills first popularised by Sir Walter Scott's romantic poem The Lady of the Lake in the 19th century. The park straddles the border between lowland and highland Scotland, encompassing a wide range of scenery.\n\nThe region is rich in history, most famously as the stamping ground of legendary outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor (1671-1734), whose exploits were the subject of the 1995 movie Rob Roy . In the 1800s, Scott's poetry inspired a flood of visitors and the birth of Scotland's tourist industry - as the Victorians romanticised mountain scenery and all things Scottish, and newfangled trains and steamboats made inroads into the wilderness.\n\nDespite the region's close proximity to Glasgow (Scotland's largest city), difficulty of access meant that the islands of Loch Lomond and the roadless hill country to its east remained an unspoilt haven for native woodland and wildlife.

The Loch Lomond Waterbus offers a network of passenger ferries that link up with hiking trails.\n\n## Fishing\n\nWith so much water around, it's no surprise that the park offers some of Scotland's finest angling. You can fish for salmon and brown trout in dozens of rivers and lochs, while the Lake of Menteith is a famous rainbow-trout fishery. Loch Lomond itself is known for its monster-sized pike and perch.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWoods and water are the key habitats in the park, with lochs and rivers rich in brown trout and salmon, otter and water vole, dragonflies and damselflies. Large areas of native birch and oak woods support mosses, lichens, and wild flowers such as primrose, bluebell and red campion, while the higher hills are home to mountain hare, red grouse and ptarmigan. One oddity is a group of Australian wallabies, introduced by a landowner in the 1940s, that roam wild on a Loch Lomond island.\n\nOSPREY Several pairs of this rare but beautiful bird of prey nest in the national park; good places to see them include Loch Venachar, Loch Lomond, Loch Eck and the Lake of Menteith.\n\nPINE MARTEN Most commonly seen around dusk and dawn, the elusive pine marten is a member of the weasel family.

The boat will take you on a tour around the islands of Loch Lomond, gliding through the picturesque narrows between Inchtavannach and Inchconnachan, and then crossing over to the nature reserve of Inchcailloch, where you might spot an osprey. Back in Luss, stroll around this pretty loch-side village before enjoying lunch in one of its tearooms.\n\nAs you continue driving stop - and down into the Trossachs. At Trossachs Pier, board a vintage Victorian steamship, the Sir Walter Scott (departs 2.30pm daily), for a onehour scenic cruise along Loch Katrine. The 18km-long loch has been Glasgow's main water supply since 1859, but it's also one of Scotland's most beautiful lakes, dotted with wooded islands at its eastern end. Afterwards, drive east along the shores of Loch Venachar to the town of Callander for fish and chips before returning to Glasgow.\n\nnorth along Loch Lomond the loch gets narrower and the mountains higher as you enter the Highlands proper.

Fish will surround you as you snorkel the azure waters and, diving deeper below the surface, you'll discover ancient shipwrecks. B\n\nGreece's first marine park and Europe's largest marine protected area safeguards six islands and 22 uninhabited islets emanating from the one inhabited island of Alonissos. In Paleolithic times the islands were joined in a sheet of land with the other Sporades islands and mainland Thessaly. By the Middle Stone Age, humans had found a home at Kokkinokastro on Alonissos. The remains of a settlement here are perhaps the oldest in all of the Aegean. The story goes that the islands were later settled by the Minoans, who travelled from Crete in the 16th century BC, and it was they who introduced the vineyards and olive groves you still see today. Successive rulers included Mycenaeans (Achilles' father is said to be buried here), Athenians, Romans, Venetians, Crusaders and Turks. Always a strategic spot along Mediterranean shipping routes, Alonissos weathered the many changes, and today you'll find a bustling harbour at Patitiri.\n\nWhile humans were going through centuries of drama, the local sea life, birds and animals continued to thrive. The park was established to protect more than 300 species of fish and about 80 species of bird. Gioura (wild goats) are endemic to an island of the same name, and dolphins and whales cavort in these waters as well. But the reluctant star of the show is the terribly endangered Mediterranean monk seal ( Monachus monachus ). With only about 600 left worldwide, half of this rarest of seals are found in Greece, and the park's Piperi island is a main breeding ground.\n\n↓ The dreamy vista of Kyra Panagia beach on Karpathos.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Avoid crowds but dive freely into warm, aqua seas by visiting in June, September or October. July and August are packed with visitors.\n\nGetting there Alonissos Marine Park encompasses a string of islands in the Sporades in the northwestern Aegean.

Only authorised companies are allowed into the park's protected areas - head out with them to cruise azure coves, dive off the boat decks and picnic on white-sand beaches, or find ancient monasteries.\n\n## Diving\n\nWith waters plied by sailing ships since ancient times, the marine park offers the rare opportunity to play amateur underwater archaeologist. Dive deep, searching for over 300 species of fish as you seek Byzantine shipwrecks or jettisoned ancient amphorae.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nAlonissos has a mild Mediterranean climate. Maquis and pine and cedar forests dot the land. Rare species include Eleonora's falcons, wild goats and Mediterranean monk seals.\n\n## MEDITERRANEAN MONK SEAL These\n\nshy, endangered seals were depicted on ancient Greek coins and mentioned in Homer's poems. Today, fewer than 600 remain in the world, and they hide in partially submerged caves to breed.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nZip around azure seas in search of rare seals, falcons and wild goats. Dive in, too.\n\n## A day\n\nSet out early by boat from Patitiri on Alonissos to take advantage of the cool morning temperatures and the best of the daylight hours. While the boat's captain will pick your route, a typical day would include cruising between the islands in the most protected areas of the park. You'll stop in azure bays to dive into the crisp water and search for Mediterranean monk seals. If you're patient, you stand a great chance of seeing dolphins, even if the seals elude you. Or become a twitcher for the day: look for species like Audouin's gulls, shags and the mighty Eleonora's falcon, hunting on high.

And although it belongs officially to Norway, you're actually much closer here to the North Pole than you are to Oslo.\n\nThis is a mythic landscape, with so many echoes of Arctic exploration and hardship, a land of such serene and silent beauty that you'll wonder if you've wandered into an Arctic fairytale. Here you'll find so many signposts to the human presence in the Arctic, forgotten outposts telling a story of humankind's desire to master the frozen north. There are, for example, the forlorn remains of 17th-century whaling stations littering the beaches like so much driftwood. There are the remnants of nobler expeditions to reach the North Pole, among them at Virgohamna on Danes Island from where the Swedish engineer Salomon August Andrée launched a failed attempt in 1897 to reach the Pole in a hydrogen balloon. And the gateway into the park, tiny Ny Ålesund, is now a research station for scientists studying the impact of global warming on the Arctic environment, not to mention one of the most remote settlements on earth.\n\nBut it is nature that has the final say out here, from the ethereal beauty of Kongsfjorden and Magdalenefjord to walrus-rich Moffen Island. At every turn, jagged peaks stab at the sky and deep, ice-filled valleys cut great scars into the interior. Such is nature's dominance that this is no place for the casual visitor and\n\ncoming here must be part of a wellequipped expedition by land or sea. But the rewards are enough scenes of sheer magnificence to last many lifetimes.\n\n↓ Sea kayaking is one of the best ways of getting up close and personal with Svalbard's remarkable wildlife.

Although longhaul winter snowmobiling expeditions from Longyearbyen may be possible, most people arrive by boat in July and August.\n\n## Getting there\n\nNordvest-Spitsbergen National Park occupies the far northwestern tip of the Svalbard archipelago (and indeed the far northwestern tip of Europe), with most of it on the main island of Spitsbergen (as the whole archipelago was once known)\n\nPark in numbers\n\n3583\n\nLand area covered (sq km)\n\nMarine area covered (sq km)\n\n3500\n\nEstimated number of polar bears in Spitsbergen\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-147 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## On board a ship\n\nIf, like most visitors, you've arrived in the park on board a ship, whether cruise or icebreaker or both, you'll appreciate retreating back to your cabin at the end of the day; even in summer, temperatures can be bitterly cold. Not that you'll be sure when day begins and ends: in summer, daylight never ends. Meals are taken on board, while inflatable Zodiacs transport you to land. Cabin accommodation ranges from the comfortable to the semi-luxurious.\n\n## Ny Ålesund\n\nScientists don't inhabit the world's most comfortable digs, but\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Visit Magdalenefjord\n\nThe landscapes of NordvestSpitsbergen National Park lend themselves easily to hyperbole but it is impossible to exaggerate the sublime beauty of Magdalenefjord, one of the most splendid Arctic landscapes on earth. The lovely bluegreen bay, flanked by towering peaks and intimidating tidewater glaciers, is the most popular anchorage along Spitsbergen's western coast. In the 17th century, this area saw heavy Dutch whaling; at Graveneset, near the mouth of the fjord, you can still see the remains of two stoves used to boil the blubber.\n\nif you end up staying here overnight (they sometimes have rooms available for visiting expeditions) you'll have the essentials somewhere warm and polar-bear proof to rest your head for the night.\n\n## Camping\n\nIf you've arrived by land, you've probably come in winter on a snowmobiling expedition. Which means that you'll be well accustomed by now to keeping watch for polar bears, carrying a gun in case one turns up, and setting up camp in the 24-hour-long night…\n\n## Watch wildlife\n\nThe park's waters are home to numerous marine mammals - several whale species have returned after centuries of hunting. Polar bears are frequently sighted, either on ice floes hunting for seals, roaming on land or swimming out to boats. Watch also for Arctic birdlife and walruses.\n\n## Explore Ny Ålesund\n\nA 1.5km trail with interpretive panels takes you around this tiny settlement's sights. In the early 20th century several polar explorers set off from Ny Ålesund, including Roald Amundsen. There are poignant memorials to these expeditions.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nPolar bears and walruses are possible anywhere, but gravelly Moffen Island hosts one of the largest walrus colonies on the planet; a 300m boat exclusion zone means you'll need a long lens. Other possible sightings include the Arctic fox (also known as the polar fox) and Svalbard's unusually squat brand of reindeer. The park contains numerous colonies of seabirds, and its sea cliffs and islands provide summer breeding perches for colonies of barnacle and brent geese, common eiders and black guillemots, among others.\n\nWALRUS The hvalross (walrus) measures up to nearly 4m and can weigh up to 1450kg; their elongated canine teeth can be 1m long in males. Although once heavily hunted for their ivory and blubber, the Svalbard population has rebounded to around 1000.\n\nPOLAR BEAR Isbjørn (polar bears), the world's largest land carnivore, weigh up to 720kg and can measure 2.5m long, but the animals are swift and agile. A polar bear's diet consists mostly of seals, beached whales, fish and birds.\n\nBARNACLE GOOSE The handsome barnacle goose has a striking black neck and crown, white face, a grey-white underbelly and silver-like colourings on the wings. The summer population on Svalbard numbers around 24,000; they winter on the UK's Solway Firth.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-148 -->\n\n硝\n\n寒\n\n諸\n\n荒\n\n藏\n\n葛\n\n等\n\n## See this...\n\n01 Blomstrandhalvøya Blomstrandhalvøya was a peninsula until the early 1990s when it was released from the icy grip on its northern end and it is now one of the newest islands in the world.\n\n02 Hot Springs The hot springs of Troll and Jotun hot springs, along the shores of the park's Bockfjorden, are believed to be the world's northernmost hot springs; water temperatures range from 24.5°C to a positively balmy 28.3°C.\n\n03 Krossfjorden Krossfjorden attracts quite a few cruise ships.

If you pull ashore to Blomstrand, look for the machinery remains of an ill-starred 1911 attempt to quarry marble; the stone was rendered worthless by aeons of freezing and thawing.\n\n## A day\n\nMost forays into the park begin at Ny Ålesund, and just about every cruise ship pulls ashore here and allows you to spend an hour or two wandering around this intriguing settlement, taking in the fascinating cultural detritus that litters the site. Watch especially for the anchor pylon which was used by Umberto Nobile and Roald Amundsen to launch the airship Norge on their successful flight over the pole to Alaska in 1926. Perhaps the most unusual attraction is the stranded steam locomotive\n\n## Two days\n\nContinuing north, you'll sail the length of Kongsfjorden, the glorious backdrop to Ny Ålesund. In summer, Kongsfjorden spectacularly contrasts bleak grey-brown shores with expansive white icefields. The distinctive Tre Kroner peaks, Dana (1175m), Svea (1226m) and Nora (1226m) - named in honour of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, respectively jut from the ice and are among Svalbard's most recognisable landmarks.

Perhaps it's the name - 'Monte Perdido' translates as 'Lost Mountain' - that lends these mountains their cachet. Or perhaps it's because the park's impossibly steep summits and forbidding mountain passes have always served as a barrier to France and the rest of Europe, preserving until well into the 20th century the sense of Spain as a place apart. Then again, perhaps it's altogether simpler than that: this is one of Europe's most beautiful corners.\n\nSo impassable is the park's wall of rock that for centuries its only human inhabitants were those with something to hide. Trade routes followed easier contours east and west of here, leaving the park's difficult pathways to smugglers and bandits, who passed through safe in the knowledge that law-enforcement officials from both Spain and France would never follow. Such inaccessibility also enabled Pyrenean wildlife to flourish far from the hunters and habitat loss that stalked wild creatures at lower altitudes. Those that survive up here, the keepers of Pyrenean secrets, are real mountain specialists, but even here there are tales of woe: the Pyrenean ibex breathed its last in January 2000.\n\nThe sense of a secretive world accessible only to a select few continues, with just 1800 people allowed in the main section of the park, the Pradera de Ordesa, at any one time - a far cry from the relentless hiking traffic so common in other popular European national parks. Thus it is that there will be moments when time will seem to stand still, when this stunning mountain\n\n↓ Aside from superb hiking, you will find stunning mountain views in the small village of Tella, also pictured on the previous page.\n\nrealm is yours and yours alone, save for the whisper of Pyrenean winds, and birds of prey circling high above.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go July and August are the best months for hiking, but they're also the most popular. Either side of these months (especially May, June and September) is generally OK, but the weather remains very unpredictable, particularly at high altitudes.\n\n## Getting there\n\nOrdesa y Monte Perdido is in northeastern Spain, in the Aragón region, which lies between Catalonia and Navarra. Torla is the main gateway village, and the nearest major airport is Zaragoza.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n156 Area covered (sq km)\n\n3348\n\nHighest point: Monte Perdido (m)\n\n130\n\nBird species recorded in the park\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-153 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Casa de San Martín\n\nFor something a little special, look no further than Casa de San Martín, nestled in a hidden valley and along a dirt track 5km off the main Torla-Aínsa road. The handsome stone house has been beautifully renovated and the rooms are temples to good taste without being overdone. It's convenient for the park and you spend days here in perfect relaxation. Meals are as exceptional as the setting, and the welcome is as warm as the sitting room with its fireplace and roaring winter blaze. This is a stunning rural retreat.\n\n## Do this!\n\nHiking The only problem with hiking in Ordesa y Monte Perdido is deciding which trails to take, so wonderful are they all. Most are challenging treks rather than leisurely strolls, although most are accessible to hikers of reasonable fitness, and a shuttle bus runs between the car park in the village of Torla and some of the trailheads inside the park. The really adventurous could combine some of the day walks into multiday hikes, but you'll need to be self-sufficient to do this. Some trails even cross the border into France, an epic Pyrenean traverse.\n\n## Hotel Villa de Torla\n\nIn the mountain hamlet of Torla, this place has tidy rooms some are spacious and stylish, others have floral bedspreads and look a little tired. But the undoubted highlight is the swimming pool and bar terrace, which have lovely views.\n\n## Hotel Villa Russell\n\nAlso in Torla, the last town before the national park and its mountains take hold, Villa Russell has enormous rooms that won't win any style awards but come with sofa, microwave and hydromassage shower. There's an on-site Jacuzzi and sauna.\n\n## Climbing\n\nThe Circo de Cotatuero has been set up with 32 iron pegs hammered into the rock; they're more a rising traverse than a vertical ladder, but you'll need a cool head. Otherwise, Monte Perdido requires mountaineering gear and skills.\n\n## Exploring Torla\n\nThis alpine village above the Río Ara is a wonderful prelude to the national park. Sample hearty mountain cooking, then wander out to the 13th-century Iglesia de San Salvador; there are fine mountain views from the small park on the church's northern side.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWith 45 mammal species and 130 kinds of bird in residence, there's plenty to keep an eye out for. Brown bears occasionally pass through, but you'd have to be exceptionally lucky to see one. Pyrenean chamois are shy, but the chances of seeing them are reasonable. Watch also for wild boars, marmots and Pyrenean desmans. Birdlife is likely to be a feature - scan the skies for the golden eagle, bearded vulture, griffon vulture, all manner of hawks, and the rather lovely royal owl.\n\n## PYRENEAN DESMAN This semi-\n\naquatic, mostly nocturnal water mole may be difficult to see, but boy will you be happy if you spot it. Just 11cm to 16cm long, it has a scaly tail and is excellent at climbing and swimming.\n\nPYRENEAN CHAMOIS A member of the goat family, this agile creature can graze as high as 3000m and has made a spectacular recovery from nearextinction in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nGRIFFON VULTURE With a wingspan of almost 3m, this unmistakable scavenging bird of prey is commonly seen surveying the high mountain valleys from rocky perches or circling high above.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-154 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Circo de Soaso A challenging 15km walk (seven hours return) follows the Valle de Ordesa to Circo de Soaso, a rocky balcony whose centrepiece is the Cola del Caballo (Horsetail) waterfall.\n\n02 Puerto de Bujaruelo This long day section of the GR11 climbs to San Nicolás de Bujaruelo, then to Puerto de Bujaruelo on the French border, before descending to Gavarnie (France).\n\n03 Balcón de Pineta This challenging hike (eight hours return) begins near Bielsa and climbs via a series of steep switchbacks to the 'Pineta Balcony' for stunning glacier and mountain views.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-155 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nThis is serious hiking country with ample opportunity to link classic Pyrenean treks, while those in vehicles can cherry-pick some of the better vantage points to enjoy.\n\n↓ Day hikers can visit the magnificent Cascada del Estrecho. ↓ The small town of Torla is the gateway to Ordesa.\n\n## A day\n\nNumerous roads circle and dip into the park. Begin at ridge-top Aïnsa, one of northern Spain's most beautiful stone villages, and drive north to Escalona, where the road branches. First take the northern branch (turn right at the fork) for the drive up to Bielsa, from where a 12km paved road runs up the Valle de Pineta in the park's northeastern corner with stunning views all the way. Return to Escalona, then follow the HU631 that bucks and weaves west over the mountains to\n\nSarvisé, crossing the park's southern tip in the process and passing through the dramatic, sinuous Bellos valley. If you're here from July to mid-September, or during Easter week, a one-way system operates on part of the Escalona-Sarvisé road. Continue on to Torla, then north to the Pradera de Ordesa, the starting point of so many trails and a pretty spot in its own right, lying in the shadow of high mountains; in summer and at Easter, private vehicles cannot drive this road, so take the shuttle bus.\n\n## Two days\n\nAfter circling the park with intent on day one, stay overnight in Torla, then set off early to undertake the Circo de Soaso high-altitude trail. This marvellous Pyrenean hike begins at the eastern end of the Pradera de Ordesa, where you cross the Río Arazas, and then climbs steeply through woods on the valley's south side. This hardest part, called the Senda de los Cazadores (Hunters' Path), in which you ascend 600m, takes an hour. Then it's level or downhill all the way along the high Faja de Pelay\n\n## Three days\n\nWith an extra day to spare, you could spend the first night in Bielsa, using it as a base to rest after attempting the spectacular Balcón de Pineta hike. If you take this option, drive via Escalona and Sarvisé to sleep the second night in Torla (or the Casa de San Martín), then hike the Circo de Soaso on day three. Another alternative to Balcón de Pineta is the Cañón de Añisclo, a gaping wound in the Earth's fabric. Although multiday walkers can reach it from the north, the southern approach path to the circo (cirque; a half-open, steep hollow at the head of a valley). The splendid views are evocatively supplemented by a beguiling sense of a mountain realm apart. Return by the path along the bottom of the valley, passing several waterfalls. The circuit takes about seven hours and you'll need to carry all your food and water. If you've time and wheels, take the detour into the gorgeous Valle de Bujaruelo that shadows the eastern boundary of the park.\n\nbegins 12km from Escalona on the road to Sarvisé from the trailhead, a broad path leads down to the dramatic Puente de San Úrbez, then up the canyon. You can walk as far north as La Ripareta and back in about five hours, or to Fuen Blanca and back in about eight hours. These southern canyons of the park present a very different vision of the Pyrenees, drawing your gaze down into the abyss rather than up to the summits of these majestic mountains.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-156 -->\n\nGetty Images | veger\n\nOulanka National Park\n\nWhite water blasts forestflanked gorges, and a unique triple act of Arctic, Siberian and European nature flourishes. Best way to see the show? Karhunkierros, Finland's most famous hike.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-157 -->\n\nT he ferocity of rapids and waterfalls, the untamed nature of Finland's greatest hiking trail, the eclectic convergence of European, Siberian and Arctic flora and fauna amid the rocky valleys… it's easy to see why visitors flock to Oulanka.\n\nIn Finland's far east near the Russian border, the park owes its improbable biodiversity to the calcium-packed bedrock and the widely fluctuating air temperatures between valleys and fell tops. Species endangered or extinct elsewhere in Finland thrive here, from calypso orchids to golden and white-tailed eagles to brown bears.\n\nThe thrust of this nature-lovers' thrill ride, though, is the rivers - and even by Finland's phenomenal standards these stand out. They channel into cacophonous rapids, they plunge over and gouge through gorges, they entice the wildlife to perform and they intensify Oulanka's lushness. The 135km-long Oulankajoki River is the park's prime artery, where superb canoeing awaits for the adventurous.\n\nAbutting these waterways is northern boreal forest: a thick fuzz of Scots pine and spruce resounding to the screech of eagles and the gurgle of warblers in summer, and drumming woodpeckers come wintertime.\n\nIt's in the forests that you'll witness the tale of how this landscape was created, unfolding as you hike through on what few deny is Finland's best batch of trails. Glaciers chiselled everything out during the last ice age, eroding the cliffs, carving dramatic valleys and depositing fine sand on the bed of the Oulankajoki River. In the past few centuries, slash-and-burn farmers created intermittent patches of pretty pastureland while felling wood to graze reindeer. Since the early 20th\n\ncentury, though, no axes or chainsaws have touched these trees and the result is a richly preserved ecosystem. No better crash course in Oulanka's contrasts can be had than on the long-distance path bisecting the park, Finland's fabled Karhunkierros (Bear's Ring), which is aptly named indeed.\n\n↓ Oulanka National Park is famed for its wild rivers and thick, verdant northern boreal forest.

Activities include memorable canoeing from the sandy beach outside, hiking on the Karhunkierros Trail and, during winter months, snow building and ice climbing. The complex lies on the lakeshore across from Juuma village.\n\n## Oulanka National Park Camping Ground\n\nIf you come to the wilderness, luxury isn't always an option. This\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Canoeing\n\nFeeling the formidable current of the Oulankajoki River helps you understand the dominance of water in lake-littered, river-riven Finland. In Oulanka, as in much of the nation's north, waterways take precedence over roads. The park has two acclaimed canoe routes, one of which takes on a 13km section of the faster upper rapids and one that follows a 25km stretch of the lower river. There are campfire sites and a hut to overnight in en route.\n\n## Hiking\n\nThe big daddy of\n\nOulanka's hikes is the 82km-long campsite is nevertheless the area's best, equipped with a sauna and photogenically situated in the midriff of the park on the banks of the Oulankajoki River just 1.5km from Oulanka Visitor Centre.\n\n## Ruka Golden Cottage\n\nRuka, Finland's best ski resort, just over 20km southwest of Oulanka, has numerous accommodation possibilities, including this inviting wooden self-catering chalet 1.2km from the Ruka chair lift.\n\nKarhunkierros Trail, but many shorter routes exist. Some, like the stroll to Kiutaköngäs waterfall, are a kilometre or two in length; others, like the strenuous tramp between the Karhunkierros and Oulanka Visitor Centres, necessitate a night's stay in a wilderness hut.\n\n## Snowshoeing\n\nThe national park has developed some scintillating snowshoeing routes, ranging from 2km to 26km in length. When Oulanka is beset by winter they offer a unique means of exploring the forests and reach areas even the trails cannot.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe rivers waylay water-sports aficionados while the forests, interrupted only by valleys or flower-filled meadows, fulfil the most intrepid hiker's expectations, but the bottom line with Oulanka is its diversity, terrain wise and temperature wise. This ensures one of Europe's most species-rich forest floors, replete with rare mosses, lichens and flowers, which in turn have boosted diversity all the way up the food chain.\n\nCALYPSO Foraging is permitted in Oulanka, but the forests - and the meadows in their midst - sport their fair share of protected plants, of which the calypso, a pale-pink member of the orchid family and the park mascot, is among the most beautiful.\n\nBROWN BEAR An estimated 1500 brown bears can be found across Finland, and in Oulanka they rule the roost among the bigger predators. Weighing up to 300kg, the mighty beasts are mainly in evidence between April and September, and they usually mate in June.\n\nRED-BREASTED FLYCATCHER One of Oulanka's more elusive avian species, the red-breasted flycatcher visits annually, and can be glimpsed at Savilampi in the northwest of the park.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-159 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Karhunkierros Trail The park's signature trail is among the toughest.

Why? Because you need to feel the white water spray as you paddle the lakes and rivers and the soaring sensation as you hike the trails, creeping breathlessly along swinging bridges over rapids or paused open-mouthed at the lavish forest beauty.\n\nThe ideal choice (in truth, the only logical one) for accommodation is Basecamp Oulanka, on the cusp between forest and lake. On a late-June day with the flora blossoming swiftly to make the most of the short summer and trails newly snow free, this makes a heavenly HQ for activities. On your first day, you're going to get wet. Hire a canoe to follow one of Basecamp Oulanka's self-guided routes, or go for a guided paddling trip: either way the fun launches on the sandy beach right outside your room. Guided excursions will occupy either the morning or the afternoon, but the only other thing you'll want to do today is relax in\n\n## Five days\n\nBegin by basing yourself in the belly of the outdoor action at Oulanka Camping Ground. There is no better way to get into the spirit of the park than by embarking on a paddling adventure, and Oulanka has won praise for its two stunning routes along the Oulankajoki River. Make a choice: 13km of proper rapids on the upper section or a gentler 25km splash along the river's lower stretches. Either way, allow two days, as stopping off en route at the campfire sites and wilderness hut is integral to the experience.\n\nthe restaurant with some succulent grilled salmon or attempt a short walk. For the latter, driving north to Oulanka Visitor Centre is best: try the gentle walk to the Kiutaköngäs waterfall. You can get initiated in the park's history and geography, and the cafe here serves tasty snacks.\n\nNext day, gather picnic supplies for an all-day tramp on the delightful but taxing Pieni Karhunkierros trail. It's a distillation of the park's charms and challenges: rapids and forested ravines hung by bridges.\n\nBefore the close of the second day, squeeze in a pootle about Oulanka Visitor Centre and a stroll to Kiutaköngäs waterfall. Stay at Oulanka Camping Ground again tonight and be sure to rest up, ready to tackle the park's classic hike tomorrow.\n\nThe park recommends that you spend two to three days hiking the trail from Oulanka Visitor Centre to Karhunkierros Visitor Centre in Hautajärvi (fit hikers can accomplish it in two). This glorious hike, one of the loveliest segments of the still-longer Karhunkierros Trail, will leave you feeling as though you have come to, seen and conquered Oulanka. Start early on your second day's tramp to hit Café Lapis at Karhunkierros Visitor Centre before closing time, and camp at the Hautajärvi Camping Ground.\n\nThe next day, it's treatyourself time: spend your final night in relative luxury at Basecamp Oulanka.

Velika Paklenica Canyon is an impressive 14km long and almost 1km wide, walled with cliffs over 700m high at some points. You can follow the rushing river downstream to Anića luka, the canyon's narrowest point, and view the crashing water from the steep clifftop. Mala Paklenica Canyon is no less stunning, though the river is calmer here. At 12km in length, it's only 2km shorter than its bigger sister, and it's around 500m wide, but the framing cliffs are just as impressive.\n\nThe mountain ranges of Borovnik and Crni Vrh are in the central part of Paklenica. Covered in lush pine forest and karst rock, they're magical seen in relief against the sky. Two valleys, Mala Močila and Velika Močila, are cradled in the mountains' lap, green vessels for the rich flora and fauna of the park. The crowning glory of Paklenica is its highest mountain, Velebit, an imposing and steely observer pockmarked with wondrous cliffs and indentations. There are around 40 caves hidden in the mountain - Vodarica is 300m long, while Bunovac crevasse reaches 534m below, making it Velebit's deepest pit. Vaganski vrh (1757m) and Sveto brdo (1753m) are Velebit's highest peaks, and hiking to the top is a must for mountain-lovers.\n\nSouth Velebit has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times, but it was the Romans who founded Argyruntum, now known as Starigrad, fortifying it with towers and making it a significant trading centre. In the Middle Ages, the Croats arrived and settled in the area. Paklenica was declared a national park in 1949.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The park is never crowded, save for the rush of climbing enthusiasts during the warmer months. Hiking is recommended in spring, summer and autumn, while winter means harsher conditions. Spring and autumn, when the flowers are out, are particularly heavenly.\n\nGetting there Paklenica is in northern Dalmatia, near Zadar (location of the nearest airport, a 45-minute drive away), on the southern side of Velebit mountain. Starigrad, the park's entry point, is on the coast at the park's foot.\n\nPark in numbers 95 Area covered (sq km)\n\n30,000\n\nAge of an excavated cave bear's skull (years)\n\n5 Permanent springs of fresh drinking water\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-162 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nCamp National Park\n\nSitting right at the park entrance, on a pebble beach, this quaint camp site is shaded by bending pine trees. It's the ideal place to return to after a day of hiking or climbing: the sea is at your toes, the mountains are at your back, and there's no better place to soak tired muscles than the waters of the Adriatic. A barbecue supper under the night sky is a real treat. There's a range of great facilities, so you get the best of all worlds.\n\n## Stone Houses Pojata and Varoš\n\nThese two traditional houses, with wooden beams and stone walls, have perfectly combined heritage with modern, comfortable and cosy lodgings. They're near the park entrance and the beach.\n\n## Holiday Home Paklenica\n\nThis small house with wood-beamed ceiling and traditional knick-knacks is 300m from the park entrance, making it super convenient for exploring the hiking trails and enjoying the park's beauties.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Mountain summiting\n\nPaklenica has around 200km of trails and paths, but most rewarding are the hikes to the high points of Velebit, both for the variety of landscapes, flora and fauna that you encounter along the way, and for the spectacular views on offer. Vaganski vrh is Velebit's highest peak and offers endless views all round on a clear day. Liburnija gives you the most stunning perspective: you can take in the entire midAdriatic archipelago.\n\n## Cave exploring\n\nManita peć is the only cave in the national park that can be visited, and it's been admired since 1937 for its abundance of speleothems (cave formations) - stalagmites, stalactites, columns and flowstones.\n\n## Climbing and hiking the canyons\n\nRock climb and admire Velika Paklenica Canyon, with its jumbles of collapsed rock and boulders creating rapids and small waterfalls in the river below, and hike Mala Paklenica Canyon, observing the rock formations and rich flora.\n\nGetty Images | Mat Robinson; Anna Gorin\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Circular Paklenica trail\n\nThe essential Paklenica route, this six-hour hike passes along Velika Paklenica Canyon, through pine and beech forests via Kapljarka cave, and back alongside Mala Paklenica Canyon.\n\n## 02 Manita Peć trail\n\nThis trail is a great way to incorporate a visit to Manita Peć cave into a light, 1½hour walk, with some great views of the karst cliffs at Anića kuk.\n\n## 03 Pjeskarica educational trail\n\nGreat for families, this undemanding 1.5km trail to Velika Paklenica Canyon takes you through dramatic landscapes occupied by diverse fauna.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-163 -->\n\nе\n\n## What to spot...\n\nPaklenica's diversity of habitats offers a wealth of flora and fauna. There is a variety of butterflies, as well as amphibians and snakes, including Orsini's viper and the spotted salamander. There are 254 species of bird, including the elusive white-backed woodpecker. Rarely spotted mammals are the brown bear, wolf and lynx. Out of 1000 plant species and subspecies recorded to date, 79 are endemic, the most exemplary being the columbine.\n\nسر\n\nORSINI'S VIPER This poisonous snake is also Europe's most endangered.

The hike includes staying in a mountain hut and camping on the mountainside. Start off early, amid the dawn chorus, and walk from Velika Paklenica Canyon, admiring the stream's waterfalls; you'll reach the Paklenica Mountain Hut in time for lunch. Another three hours' hike to Struge takes you through beech forests and glacial deposits, as well as through some stalactites, columns and flowstones. Take some warm clothes for the tour since the temperature inside the cave is a constant 9°C throughout the year. Back outside, have your lunch under the trees and let your eyes adjust to daylight again, and then start making your way back down towards Starigrad.

To the north, the Dark Peak is an atmospheric carpet of purple moorland and gritstone outcrops, a rival to the Lake District for English natural beauty. To the south, the White Peak rises over limestone bedrock, pockmarked with caves, sliced by rocky gorges and dotted with relics from the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Peak District - that's 'Peak' singular, never 'The Peaks' - was the first national park in Britain, founded in 1951, and the birthplace of hill-walking, thanks to the Kinder Trespass of 1932, which liberated the British countryside from the landed gentry and handed it to the people. This national park doesn't just preserve animals and plants, though many of England's most enigmatic creatures are found here. It also preserves the very history of industry - the mills that produced the first ever bolts of machine-made cloth, and the mines and quarries that turned metal-working from a cottage industry into a national endeavour.\n\nHow you experience the Peak is up to you. You might want to stand in serene silence, surrounded by its natural beauty and buffeted by the wind that scours the desolate moors of the Dark Peak. You might want to pit mind and muscle against some of England's most gruelling climbing and mountain-biking routes. You might decide to wriggle through the twisting caves that wormhole through the White Peak. You may prefer to hopscotch around the mills, quarries and philanthropic institutions of\n\nRichard Arkwright's Industrial Revolution. Or there's always the genteel option: exploring historic market towns, sipping real ale in country pubs, and wandering around fabulous stately homes.\n\n- ↓ Rock climbers tackle the historic gritstone cliffs of Stanage Edge in 1964.\n- ↓ Wind-worn gritstone edges on Kinder Scout overlook Kinder Reservoir.

Summer is peak season (as it were) for outdoor activities and natural beauty, but the crowds diminish in spring and autumn, when flowering heather paints the Dark Peak a rich purple.\n\nGetting there The park spills from Derbyshire into most neighbouring counties. Manchester and Sheffield are the main gateways, and four railway lines provide access to the heart of the Peak.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n1437 Area covered (sq km)\n\n636\n\nHighest point: Kinder Scout (m)\n\n173370 Years that gave birth to the Industrial Revolution\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-167 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Old Hall Hotel\n\nMary, Queen of Scots, was a resident at the Old Hall, which claims to be England's oldest hotel. Dripping with ivy and serving award-winning breakfasts, it's the pride of Buxton, the unofficial capital of the Peak. Rooms have been modernised since this place was used as an Elizabethan gaol, but there's still plenty of frilly brocade in Mary's Bower, the room where the unfortunate royal is said to have been interned.\n\n## Hartington Hall YHA\n\nBudget travellers can live like the lord of the manor in this wood-\n\n## Do this!\n\nWalking over hill and dale You'll have plenty of company on a Peak District walk, but isolation was never the main appeal here. Trails pick their way between country villages, so there's a roaring fire and a refreshing pint waiting at the end of every hike.

Bike hire is available at Hassop station and Blackwell Mill.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWhile sheep are the most common residents of the Peak District, proper wildlife abounds on the higher ground. Hares box on the hillsides, otters gambol in the brooks, foxes and hedgehogs pick their way along the hedgerows, bats swoop out of hidden caves, and owls, kestrels and buzzards mop up any smaller animals foolish enough to venture within swooping distance. Some 161 species here have been identified as endangered, including Derbyshire feather moss, found only in a single stream.\n\nHEDGEHOG Once so common as to be almost a cliché, hedgehogs have been poisoned, de-homed and flattened out of many of their former habitats, but they still thrive in the dales of the Peak District.\n\nERICACEAE (HEATHER) Without heather, there would be no Dark Peak: the area takes its name from the heather-clad moorlands that burst into flower every autumn, adding a distinctive maroon wash to the landscape.\n\nDERBYSHIRE FEATHER MOSS The entire world stock of Derbyshire feather moss can be found in a single square yard of stream bed in Cressbrook Dale. The exact location is kept secret to deter collectors.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-168 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Limestone Way This 73km trail rambles over the rolling hills and dales of the White Peak, starting from picturesque Castleton and ending up in Ashbourne.\n\n## 02 Tissington Trail\n\nA rewarding 21km tramp or cycle from Ashbourne to Parsley Hay follows the path of the vanished Ashbourne Line, once used by Victorian holidaymakers fleeing the smog-filled cities.\n\n## 03 High Peak Trail\n\nFollowing another vanished railway line, this time for the Cromford and High Peak Railway, this walk climbs to stunning views along the 27km between Dowlow and Cromford.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-169 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nRamble from country house to country house, rent a bike and roll through the heartland of the Industrial Revolution, or get far from the crowds on the solemn moorlands of the Dark Peak.\n\n↓ The Peak District has superb mountain biking; a rider climbs Mam Tor with Edale Valley below. ↓ The rather grand Buxton Opera House hosts an eclectic range of performances in its 902-seat theatre.\n\n## Two days\n\nIf you only have a few days in the Peak, get right to the heart of things in Buxton. This historic town is a photogenic jumble of Georgian and Victorian buildings, like a Peak District version of Bath transplanted to the Derbyshire dales. It's a gorgeous place to wander, with a famous opera festival every July. Predictably for a Victorian resort, you can also sample the local spring water. Just 1.6km from the centre is Poole's Cavern, where 28 steps drop into a limestone garden of stalactites and stalagmites, and a 20-minute climb above the cavern car park will take you to Solomon's Temple, a Victorian folly that offers sweeping views over Buxton and the dales. That should give you the appetite for a boozy evening of local cask ales at the Buxton Tap House, or a more refined meal with the opera set at Columbine Restaurant.\n\nStart early on the second day and follow the back roads to Eyam, whose medieval villagers voluntarily quarantined themselves and succumbed\n\n## A week\n\nA week gives you time to daisy-chain some of the splendid walking, cycling and horse-riding trails that criss-cross the national park. Kick off by cycling the Tissington Trail, starting at Ashbourne, and feel like a Victorian holidaymaker as you pedal north under a canopy of trees. At Thorpe you can duck off the trail to visit Dovedale, where an oft-photographed line of stepping stones crosses the Dove River. At Parsley Hay, jump tracks to the High Peak Trail, continuing on to Buxton, the heart of to the Black Death in order to protect their neighbours. Fill up on carbs in nearby Castleton - if you come on 29 May, for the agreeably Wicker Man-esque crowning of the Garland King, all the better - then point your compass north over the ridge to Edale, following the 4.5km trail via Mam Tor. On your way back to Castleton, there should just be time enough to duck into Speedwell Cavern, for a Lord of the Rings -style ride through flooded tunnels to a secret subterranean lake.\n\nthe Peak District. Take the waters and see an opera, then roll on to Bakewell to sample the Peak District's most famous pud. After a night in Bakewell, take tea at Chatsworth House, the lavish 16thcentury residence of the phenomenally wealthy Bess of Hardwick, then pick up the Monsal Trail, which meanders east through a string of eerie old railway tunnels. Along the way, you can duck into such 18th-century landmarks as the model cotton-millers' village at Cressbrook, and\n\nLitton Mill, where orphans were worked to an early grave by the villainous Ellis Needham. From the end point at Blackwell Mill, it's a short hop to pretty little Chapel-en-le-Frith and on to Castleton, with its ruined castle and caverns. Squeeze through Winnats Pass to reach Edale, starting point for walks onto the Dark Peak, tracing the routes followed by the Kinder trespassers.

And unlike most national parks, the preserve, too, seems to play hopscotch through the peninsula, protecting only the most coveted tracts of land and sea. T\n\nLike the region's natural assets, Pembrokeshire's elaborate human history plays out in striking fashion. Neolithic tombs, Iron Age Celtic weapons, Roman copper hoards, cornerstones and the more obvious stone castles, vestiges of the Norman invasion and the growth of medieval England, tell the tale of almost 30,000 years of human occupation.\n\nPembrokeshire's elemental symphony of sea, wind and stone has a stirring effect on the soul and the region has been Wales' veritable holy land for over 2000 years. The country's patron saint was born within the confines of today's national park, and it is commonly believed that a journey twice undertaken to the cathedral in St Davids bears as much religious gravity as a pilgrimage to Rome. It's easy to fathom why the western recesses of the country have become so hallowed - even beyond the area's birthright.\n\nThe modern-day Pembrokeshire coast now lures different devotees: holidaymakers from around the United Kingdom, and sometimes beyond. They perform their pilgrimages in droves, especially during the warmer months, worshipping the dozens of broad Blue Flag beaches with cool tropical-\n\nblue waters, visiting the tiny towns cheered by a disorganised canvas of primary and pastel colours, tasting stellar fresh food that firmly refutes any stigmas about British cuisine, and experiencing the trademark Welsh hospitality - the cosiness of the reserve personified.\n\n- ↓ The remote Marloes Sands is popular with bodyboarders.\n- ↓ The uniquely Welsh sport of coasteering - traversing the coast via swimming and climbing.

Waterfall walks, canoeing and marsh treks are but minutes away.\n\n## Visiting St Davids\n\nThe smallest city in Britain, St Davids is named for the eponymous patron saint of Wales, born just steps away at St Nons, and it's regarded as exceptionally holy.\n\n## Surfing\n\nMore than 50 pristine beaches throughout the park add up to plenty of prime surfing spots for every level of ability. Pembrokeshire's coastline is generally considered the best for the sport in the entirety of Great Britain because the island's prevailing winds - from the southwest - foster consistent, broad waves.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWith habitats ranging from ocean to upland pasture, the Pembrokeshire coast fosters a diverse array of organisms that includes large marine mammals and delicate highland flowers. The park's southern limestone cliffs and golden beaches slowly give way to terrain marked by more severe geological activity, such as glacial floodplains and curved volcanic hills.

The glacial fields that covered these mountains during the ice age of the Pleistocene era are nowhere to be seen. Still, the moraines, glacial deposits and deep, U-shaped valleys hint at the violent climatic events that shaped this land.\n\nThe first signs of human presence here date to around 6000 BC. Later inhabitants left behind dolmens, megalithic stone tombs and hints of ancient agriculture and animal husbandry. Two thousand years ago, Romans made their mark, with the remains of their stone roads and millenarian markers still dotting the landscape. The Buri, a Germanic tribe, settled in these mountains in the 5th century AD after invading the Iberian Peninsula, before the region was incorporated into the kingdom of Galicia and León and finally became part of Portugal.\n\nSummer visitors to Peneda-\n\nGerês will find plenty of stunning rivers to swim in.\n\nPrevious page: the Cávado River winds its way through the peaks.\n\nPortugal's first - and only - national park came into being in 1971, in a bid to conserve the unique environment and the traditional way of rural life at the same time.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go April to May, when flowers are in bloom, is great for walking.

Their sturdy stone interiors accommodate up to eight people; the fireplaces, low ceilings and antique furniture add character; and fresh bread is delivered to your doorstep every morning. Don't wish to cook? Village restaurants serve such local specialities as Portuguese stew and Soajo-style grilled goat.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Exploring villages\n\nVisiting mountain villages in the Serra da Peneda is a step back in time, with packhorses carrying supplies along the trails, oxen working the fields and black-clad widows walking the cobbled streets. In Castro Laboreiro and Montalegre, explore the striking castle ruins. In Soajo, look for the mausoleum-like 18th-century espigueiros . Pitões das Júnias is an excellent place to observe traditional farming techniques. In early September, catch the Nossa Senhora da Peneda festival in Peneda, with candlelit processions and music put on by thousands of pilgrims.\n\n## Peneda Hotel\n\nThis mountain lodge overlooks the Peneda village across the picturesque ravine and a roaring creek below. Formerly a refuge for pilgrims visiting the historic Senhora da Peneda church, the hotel is bright and cosy and has a good restaurant.\n\n## Hotel Baltazar\n\nIn the centre of Gerês village, this family-run, 19th-century granite hotel accommodates guests in large, modern rooms overlooking a woodland. The in-house restaurant serves exemplary regional cuisine and the hotel is a stone's throw from the hot springs.\n\n## Horse riding\n\nWild Garrano horses are native denizens of the park; a number of them have been tamed and can be ridden along the shepherds' trails or into the mountains. Equestrian schools in Gerês offer lessons and day rides.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nThe area's winding mountain roads, precipitous dirt tracks and the ancient stone slabs of the Geira Romana are popular with cycling tours and independent cyclists. Combine steep climbs to viewpoints with rides through forests and dips in waterfalls and thermal springs.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nPeneda-Gerês National Park encompasses high mountain plateaus and deep valleys; rainfall is high. The climate is cool in the highlands and mild in the valleys, with hot summers. Habitats include regenerating oak forests, riparian areas and peat bogs, with lots of granite formations in between. Large diurnal mammals include Spanish ibex, Garrano horses and roe deer, while nocturnal hunters include wolves. In the sky, look out for hen harriers, yellowhammers and European honey buzzards.\n\nPYRENEAN DESMAN The last of its evolutionary line, this semi-aquatic mammal is a strong swimmer, with a long nose, huge, webbed back feet and a scaly tail. The size of a hamster, it's strictly nocturnal.\n\n## MEDITERRANEAN HORSESHOE BAT\n\nNamed after its horseshoe-shaped noseleaf, this mediumsized, gregarious bat roosts in colonies of up to 2000 individuals in woodlands, olive groves and caves. These nocturnal hunters prey on moths and other insects.\n\nIBERIAN SHREW These small, mole-like mammals are nocturnal and feed mainly on insects. Endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, they are among the few mammal species besides whales that communicate through a series of ultrasonic squeaks.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-179 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Geira Romana\n\nThe longest hike in the park, this 29.7km trail follows the 2000-year-old Roman road through oak woods from Portela do Homem through to Lobios, near to the Spanish border.\n\n## 02 Cidade de Calcedónia trail\n\nClimb up to the Cabeço Calcedónia viewpoint for all-encompassing mountain views from the road that snakes over the ridge from Gerês village.

Peneda's granite houses cluster on both sides of a precipitous ravine, against a mountain-and-waterfall backdrop. In the village, you can explore the Igreja Senhora de Peneda, a historic church that attracts thousands of pilgrims each year. A short, steep 1km trail starts behind the church and winds its way up the mountain to the humanmade lake high above the village. If you're lucky, you may spot some wild Garrano horses grazing in the grasslands. If you're feeling energetic, the 8km trail past the lake makes for a pleasant and not too difficult walk that leads you through some woodlands and takes you back to the highway just above Peneda. On the way back to Braga, stop at Soajo to admire the 18th-century espigueiros - granite caskets on stilts that look like mausoleums but were used to protect corn harvests.\n\n## Three days\n\nGet the best of the park by mountain bike by climbing up to the Pedra Bela viewpoint from Caldas do Gerês via a 35km trail. Then make your way down dirt trails to Rio Arado for a swim in the Cascata do Tahiti, returning to the starting point via rural roads and small, picturesque villages. Overnighting in Caldas do Gerês, test your mettle with a fairly strenuous 50km loop the following day. The Rota de Sombras takes you up into the high mountains, alternating\n\n## A week\n\nHaving your own wheels lets you make the most of the park's three mountain ranges. In Serra da Peneda, spend a day or two exploring Soajo's espigueiros and Peneda's church before heading north to Castro Laboreiro, hiking up to its 16th-century castle and taking on the 17km Trilho Castrejo. Then drive south through Lindoso, with its own impressive castle, and Ermita, a traditional mountain village that sees few visitors, before heading east to Campo do Gerês. In the reservoir nearby, you between paved, narrow roads and bumpy dirt trails, and the views of the surrounding mountain range are second to none. Descend along a dirt trail to Rio Caldo and reward yourself with a soak in the river's thermal pools. On the last day, climb up to the Mata de Albergaria, one of the region's oak forests. The trail crosses into Spain and cuts across the Geira Romana. Then make your way to Campo do Gêres past Vilarinho da Furna, an eerie village flooded by a 1970s dam.\n\ncan spot the eerie ruins of village-made-Atlantis Vilarinho da Furna. Two excellent loop trails and horse-riding excursions are reasons to linger. More great hiking, including a tough trail to Arado waterfall and trails that link to the Geira Romana, is found around Vila do Gerês. Finish your tour with a day or two in the eastern part of the park, stopping in Cabril for grilled cabrito (baby goat) and heading up to Montalegre, the park's eastern gateway, to marvel at its beautiful 14th-century castle.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-181 -->\n\nPicos de Europa\n\n## 42 SPAIN\n\nThe 'Peaks of Europe' might seem a presumptuously grand name, but this northern Spanish national park lives up to its billing.\n\nShutterstock | Arseniy Rossikhin\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-182 -->\n\nY ou're standing by a glacial lake. Soaring, jagged peaks surround you, as do some indifferent cattle. And in your head swim two startling facts: this is the place where the Spanish Reconquista started 1300 years ago, and just a few kilometres away a brown bear could be taking a nap. If that doesn't make you take note, then some of the mouth-numbingly strong Cabrales cheese and the local firewater, orujo , should do the trick. The Picos de Europa straddles three Spanish regions (Asturias, Cantabria and Castilla y León), and packs history, activities, wildlife and culture into a small space.\n\nIn the early 8th century the area was the stronghold for Pelayo and his band of Visigoths who, against the odds, defeated the invading Moors and established a Christian kingdom here. Today, the park is now a refuge of a different kind endangered species like the Cantabrian brown bear and the Iberian wolf roam here, as do Pyrenean chamois and an array of amphibians and birds, including the reintroduced lammergeier (bearded vulture).\n\nSpain's first national park offers dozens of outdoor options. Hike the famous - and famously popular - Garganta del Cares gorge, or pick a quieter trail where wild flowers and birds are your only companions. Climb one of the limestone mountains, maybe Naranjo de Bulnes, the region's best-known peak, with a distinctive shape and a name that translates to the Orange Tree of Bulnes village. Get out on the water with a kayaking expedition down the Sella River. Go canyoning in the ravines. Or get up in the clouds the easy way with the Fuente Dé\n\ncable car, before enjoying dinner in one of the Picos' pretty villages. There you can recount tales of bear-paw prints and blisters.\n\n↓ Fuente Dé cable car whisks visitors up 753-vertigo-inducingmetres in four short minutes.

The nearest airports are Asturias and Santander, both 90 minutes from the park. Madrid is a five-hour drive away.\n\n## Park in numbers\n\n671\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n2650\n\nHighest peak: Torre Cerredo (m)\n\nEstimated number of\n\n30 brown bears\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-183 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nParador de Cangas de Onís\n\nSpain's national hotel chain likes its historic buildings, and its parador in the town of Cangas de Onís, former capital of Asturias and current hub for the western Picos, doesn't disappoint. The former San Pedro monastery is now a stylish sleeping option where the spacious, comfortable rooms, some with fourposter beds, are a far cry from what the monks would have enjoyed. A beautiful garden, an old church with medieval carvings, and a great restaurant serving local specialities add to the appeal.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Walking the Garganta del Cares\n\nThe 'Throat of the Cares' walk is the most popular hike in the Picos. Best walked from north (Poncebos in Asturias) to south (Caín in Castilla y León), the route cuts a relatively short 10km trail through kilometrehigh cliffs, following the Cares River. The trail is a mix of steep paths, bridges and tunnels that take you alongside and sometimes through the limestone walls, while alternately barren and green landscapes provide a stunning, picture-perfect backdrop.\n\n## La Casa de las Chimeneas\n\nThe 'Chimney House' is actually a collection of apartments in a farmstead that dates back centuries. Original architectural features have been retained, and a social room, pool and garden allow mingling with other Picos-goers and wonderful mountain views.\n\n## Posada del Valle\n\nGreat design and eco-friendly credentials make this one of the best sleeping options in the area. Meals use produce from the organic garden; decor takes its cue from local culture; and the hosts are a wealth of information on the Picos.\n\n## Taking the Fuente Dé cable car\n\nFor a lammergeier's view of the southern Picos, take an exhilarating ride on the Fuente Dé cable car. Whizz up an ear-popping 753m in just four minutes to soak up the views at the cafe or head out on a trail.\n\n## Eating cheese and drinking cider\n\nTraditionally wrapped in sycamore leaves and left in local caves to ripen, pungent Cabrales is a blue cheese to be reckoned with. Wash it down with some potent local cider (after gaping in awe at how it's poured) for a true Picos experience.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nFour distinct seasons, traditional and sustainable farming practices, and large sections that are too isolated for human encroachment mean a huge variety of flora and fauna exist in the Picos. Deer, badgers and even wild boar are commonplace. Pyrenean chamois are the animals you're most likely to see; elusive Cantabrian bears and Iberian wolves, the least. Alpine plants thrive in the climate here, as do many species of bird, including several types of bird of prey, and around 150 types of butterfly.\n\nLAMMERGEIER Once extinct in the Picos, the lammergeier (bearded vulture) is making a slow comeback thanks to a recovery programme that began in 2002.\n\nIBERIAN WOLF A few dozen wolves are clinging on in the region, their protected status often tenuous; some are blamed for attacking livestock and are shot by farmers.\n\nPYRENEAN CHAMOIS This goatantelope species is the most emblematic animal in the Picos. Their daring acts of mountainside leaping look like a show put on especially for visitors.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-184 -->\n\nSee this...\n\n## 01 Basílica de Covadonga\n\nThis 19th-century church commemorates 8th-century events and the start of the Spanish Reconquista. Visigoth leader Pelayo prayed to the Virgin Mary here and subsequently defeated a Moorish force.\n\n## 02 Lagos de Covadonga\n\nGlacial lakes Enol and Ercina have 360-degree mountain views, grazing cows and easy hikes. The Mirador de la Reina on the twisty road up has views fit for a queen.\n\n## 03 Bulnes\n\nInaccessible by road, for centuries this pretty village could be reached only via an uphill hike. These days a tunnel railway does the hard work.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-185 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nThough small, the Picos deserve at least a few days' exploration. The park can be approached from different sides, but whichever way you explore it you're guaranteed a thrilling trip.\n\n↓ With stunning scenery, long climbs and little traffic, Picos de Europa is a cyclist's paradise. ↓ The cliff-side shrine of Santa Cueva de Covadonga is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\n## A day\n\nIf you really only have a day to spend here then you have two choices for getting a taste of the Picos that will have you planning your next visit before you've even finished this one. For an easy overview of the best of the park, take the scenic road up to the Basílica de Covadonga to see why this bit of Spain has such historical significance. Continue up to the Covadonga lakes and strike out on one of the easy hikes in the area, before dining in true Asturian style at El Molín de la Pedrera in Cangas de Onís. Alternatively, be wowed by nature and get a good workout for your legs by heading straight for the park's most famous walk, the Garganta del Cares. You'll have to double back on yourself to finish in one day, but with views like this you really won't mind, especially when you can replenish those lost calories at the Restaurante Cares, near the start of the walk in Arenas de Cabrales.\n\n## A long weekend\n\nStart your weekend with a Friday night of monastic splendour at the Parador de Cangas de Onís, unofficial capital of the Picos and a good jumping-off spot for exploring the park. An early start the next morning will have you hitting the famous Garganta del Cares trail before the crowds, allowing you time for a delicious dinner in Restaurante Cares before bedding down in the rustic charm of La Portiella del Llosu hotel in Pandiello. After a hearty home-cooked breakfast, it's a winding but stunning couple of\n\n## A week\n\nWith no roads entirely crossing the national park, you need to do a circuit around the Picos, detouring off down dead-end side roads, to fully appreciate everything the region has to offer - and a seven-day itinerary gives you time to do that. Enjoy a couple of nights in what passes for a big town in these parts: Cangas de Onís. It has plenty of sleeping and eating options, and it's a perfect base for expeditions to Covadonga's history-heavy basilica and beautiful lakes, as well as activities like kayaking down hours' drive to Fuente Dé, where after yesterday's exertions you can let the cable car take the strain. Head heavenwards to a height of over 1800m to enjoy unsurprisingly spectacular views across the southern section of the Picos mountains and, if your legs are game, head out on another hike. Finish the weekend with a night of rural comfort in La Casa de las Chimeneas, where medieval-inspired murals decorate the walls and light meals are available in the 'English Tavern' bar.\n\nthe Sella River from nearby Arriondas. Next, walk the Cares trail - at a leisurely pace because you have time to overnight in Caín before returning the following day, stopping off for some Cabrales cheese, cider and a rest in Arenas. Loop round to the Fuente Dé cable car for jaw-dropping panoramas, before staying over in the Casa del Oso, where you can also learn about local brown bears. Finally, potter around Potes and the Santo Toribio monastery, which has been here for more than a thousand years.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-186 -->\n\n—\n\nvə\n\nniy\n\n시‏\n\nجيجه\n\n=ב\n\n79\n\nҺ‏\n\nہگ\n\nکو\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-187 -->\n\n500px | Stefan Zahariev\n\nPirin National Park\n\n## 43 BULGARIA\n\nHear the rumble of the thunder god in Bulgaria's wild southwest, where ancient pine forests cluster between glacier-carved peaks.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-188 -->\n\nA s you walk through Pirin National Park, twigs fallen from millennium-old trees snap underfoot. Your ears prick at the sound of mountain goats scrambling out of view. Claps of thunder echo in the valleys and winds brew seemingly from nowhere, making tree branches sway.\n\nTo some ancient Slavic cultures, this chorus of sounds augured the presence of thunder god Perun, for whom the Pirin mountains are thought to be named. This wilderness's fierce weather changes and towering mountains - more than 100 peaks top 2000m - make this bearded, axewielding god an apt figurehead.\n\nPerun was part of a pantheon worshipped across Eastern Europe until Christianity began to dominate from the 10th century. The god is associated with high winds, soaring eagles and sacred trees, which remain part of the park's timeless backdrop.\n\nThe ancient is omnipresent in Pirin National Park: one of the most popular sights is the Baykuchevata Macedonian pine, a tree well over a thousand years old. For pagan worshippers centuries ago, ancient trees were a sacred calling card of Perun, thought to have their roots in the world of the dead, their trunks representing the living, and their branches stretching heavenward.\n\nFurther back in the park's timeline, scars from the last ice age are still vivid. Dozens of glacial lakes hark back to the grind of ice that shaped the Pirin region into chasms of granite and soaring limestone peaks.\n\nThough established as a national park in 1962 and gilded with Unesco World Heritage status 31 years later, this place\n\nhas been impossible to tame. Expect raw wilderness, simple hiking huts and a patchy phone signal.

The building is styled in brooding granite, and its apartments are simple but chic, with pop-art flourishes and huge windows overlooking Bansko's rooftops. Spa offerings include a luxurious Jacuzzi and sauna, plus mountain views right from the pool. Best of all, you can muse on a tough day of hiking from an outdoor terrace bar, to a soundtrack of ice clinking merrily in your cocktail.\n\n## Do this!\n\nSnowshoeing Between January and March, the Pirin Mountains slip on a downy coat of snow. Busy Bansko lies just north of the park, as notorious for its nightlife as for its skiing. But the national park's high-altitude plateaus offer serenity in the snow. Clamp on snowshoes and trudge through miles of white, pillowy countryside; some of the loveliest views are around frozen Popovo Lake. The risk of avalanche in this pristine place makes a local guide essential (reserve ahead). Some operators offer night walks, allowing you to see snowdrifts sparkling under moonlight.\n\n## Hotel Alpin\n\nSimple rooms fill this cheerful, chalet-style hotel in Bansko. Summer guests can scorch their supper on barbecue equipment, and there's ski storage for winter. Snow or sunshine, there's a sauna to work up a sweat, and a tavern awash in rakia (fruit brandy) if you need topping up.\n\n## Tofana Hotel\n\nJust within the boundary of the national park, this homely hotel is surrounded by prickly pines and located roughly 300m from the nearest lift in the Chalin valog ski area - you can schuss right to the door.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nSteel your nerves for a dizzying descent: from the Bezbog chairlift in the eastern part of the park, you can access thrilling downhill biking trails. Several outfits run guided biking day trips from Bansko.\n\n## Birdwatching\n\nPirin is home to more than 170 species of bird; the most colourful are rock thrush, wallcreepers and robins. Prime your binoculars for peregrine falcons and golden eagles in the valleys, and listen for the rattle of four kinds of woodpecker in the forests.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nJackals, bears, wolves and boar all bare fangs in Pirin's forests and mountain passes, and chamois gather in herds. Less prone to bolting from human company are Hermann's tortoises - you'll know it's mating season if the bushes shake and you hear a comical chirrup (really). Almost 40 percent of Bulgaria's bird species fly through: forest dwellers include woodpeckers, robins and pygmy owls, while falcons and golden eagles soar over ravines. Endemic plants include bright Pirin poppies and Pirin thyme, and look out for lucky edelweiss.\n\nEURASIAN OTTER These sleek little mammals can be seen gnawing on fish and cavorting in streams at numerous places in the park; keep your eyes open along the waterways threading the Banderishki Lakes area.\n\nEDELWEISS See this star-shaped flower a Pirin emblem - bloom in park meadows during July and August.

Start early at Bansko's park information centre to get hiking maps and advice on weather conditions. While you're in town, stuff your rucksack with picnic provisions: spinach banitsa (pastry), cured hams and energyboosting halva (sesame nougat) should do the trick. Take ulitsa Pirin southwest out of town for around 15km, towards Banderitsa Hut in the midst of the park. From here you can set out on a five-hour hiking circuit, heading west through glades and scrambling up mountain paths to Premkata Saddle. After the challenging uphill climb, and beneath Mount Vihren (2914m), your (now squashed) banitsa will taste all the better. Return the same way and refresh yourself with a cold lemonade at Banderitsa Hut before taking the road out of the park. Make a short diversion at the edge of the park to 'the Secret Hotel', known for its party atmosphere, and toast the day's hike before returning to Bansko.\n\n## A weekend\n\nFill your pockets with hiking snacks in Bansko before driving towards Vihren Chalet, the centre of the park and the starting point of numerous trails. Spend the day hiking a circuit around the Banderishki Lakes, pausing at Fish and Frog Lakes, cobalt Long Lake, and blink-and-you'llmiss-it Eye Lake. Long Lake has some of the best views of Mount Vihren, so it's an ideal place to picnic before returning to Vihren Chalet.\n\nOn day two, set out from the chalet to tackle Mount Vihren herself. Reaching\n\n## Four days\n\nConsider yourself a hardened hiker? Take a taxi from Bansko to Vihren Chalet, and enjoy your pick of trails on the slopes of the park's loftiest peak, keeping an eye out for edelweiss. Spare some time to muse on your mortality at the 1380-yearold Macedonian pine, a halfhour walk from the chalet.\n\nAfter resting in Vihren Chalet overnight, take a long, meandering hike among the Banderishki Lakes, aiming to finish the day at Demianitsa Hut, 5km southeast.\n\nOn day three, set your sights on Bezbog Lake, 5km the summit from the southwestern slopes is an energy-sapping three-hour hike, but you'll quickly forget your blistered feet as you contemplate the resulting Pirin panorama. After climbing down, drive back into Bansko to unwind.

But rather than being separate entities of still waters, the lakes are in fact one body of constantly flowing, confluent rivers, separated by natural dams - a collection of travertine or tufa (chalk rock) deposits, packed with moss, algae and various forms of bacteria. The colour of the lakes - divided into 12 upper lakes and four lower lakes - shifts from turquoise to pea green, steel grey or deep blue, depending on the current make-up of the organisms in the water, its mineral composition, and sunlight. The 18km of wooden pathways and bridges makes it possible for visitors to meander among the lakes at their own pace. Plitvice also has abundant forest flora and is home to such wildlife as brown bears, wolves and lynx, and a variety of deer.\n\nThe area reflects the many invading and settling populations that have crossed the greater region, among them the Illyrians, Celts, Romans, Avars, Slavs and Ottomans. The Croats arrived in the 6th century, and Plitvice formed part of the medieval kingdom of Croatia, remaining thus until 1528, when the Ottomans took over for 150 years. After its stint as an important site for the anti-Fascist movement in WWII, Plitvice Lakes was declared a national park in 1949, and it was placed on the Unesco World Heritage List in 1979. Unfortunately, Plitvice was embroiled in the 1990s conflict, when, due to the apparent risk of mines, the park found itself on Unesco's List of World Heritage in Danger. After the\n\nconflict ended, the park bounced straight back and it's now visited by more than a million tourists a year.\n\n- ↓ Plitvice is full of paths to explore.

The lakes of Prošćansko and Kozjak are the largest, and among the 12 upper lakes. See the gorgeous Labudovac waterfall, which is over 20m high, at Okrugljak Lake, and the Cave Garden below. Get a boat from Kozjak to the lower lakes, where you can stand in awe of the Veliki Slap, Croatia's tallest waterfall.\n\n## Hotel Jezero\n\nStay at this 1980s throwback if you want to travel to the Yugoslavian yesteryear and have a room overlooking the largest lake in the park, within earshot of the waterfalls. Don't expect much from the restaurant.\n\n## Hotel Plitvice\n\nRight at the entrance to the park and built in 1958, this place has a look of functional architecture that relies heavily on the cubic form, but the effect is relieved by the lush surroundings. The hotel was recently refurbished and aims for modest modernity.\n\n## Veliki Slap\n\nCascading down several levels of karst rock and stretching up 78m, the Veliki Slap is bound to leave you gawping in awe; the jadegreen water and emerald vegetation will make you feel as if you're in the middle of the Amazon.\n\n## Šupljara cave\n\nGoing underground into Šupljara you might spot (or miss) the tiny, 1mm snail Zospeum isselianum , or the minuscule Meusel pseudoscorpion , both endemic to Croatia. The cave was used in Italian and German spaghetti Westerns, filmed in the 1960s in Plitvice Lakes.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe park has a mild Continental climate, with the mountains at the back cooling the coastal temperatures, and blessing the region with a wonderful mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation. Plitvice is dense with beech and fir forests, and the unique combination of microclimates and differing soils and altitude levels makes for abundant flora - there are 55 species of orchid, for instance. The park is one of Europe's last resorts for the brown bear and wolf.\n\n## EURASIAN EAGLE-OWL\n\nThe eagle-owl is one of the largest of the owl species, and has a tawny body and protruding ear tufts. You might spot it by its glowing orange eyes.\n\nLADY'S-SLIPPER ORCHID This limestone-keen beauty is a protected species; its crimson and yellow flower traps insects in its pouch so they fertilise it by having to climb inside.\n\n## EUROPEAN POND TURTLE\n\nA lover of wetlands and wooded landscapes, the pond turtle is semi-aquatic and dark in colour. It nests near water and can live up to 60 years.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-196 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Medveđak trails Choose between the two 800m-plus peaks: Oštri Medveđak (889m) or Tupi Medveđak (868m), connected by untouched 700-year-old beech forests.\n\n02 Turčić trail The Turčić peak (801m) is reached via a mild 8km karst track that is occasionally shaded by spruce woods. You'll have views of the Veliki Slap and Kozjak Lake from the top.\n\n03 Čorkova Bay A fantastic way to get a good look at the park's flora and fauna is this 21km hike through large forests teeming with wildlife and vegetation. Listen out for the woodpeckers.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-197 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nSpend two days exploring the park and walking its diverse trails, where bird- and plant-spotting opportunities abound; you can hike to mountain peaks on day three.\n\n↓ Hikers exploring around Galovac Lake. ↓ The dense beech and fir forests of Plitvice are home to abundant plant and animal life.\n\nthorough going-through of the park can take most of the day, you can eat your picnic lunch in a shaded, wooded spot, by one of the smaller lakes, while the jade-green waters shimmer below. Head back and get an early night so that on day two you can start early, choosing one of two walking trails - either the Čorkova Bay trail (21km) or the shorter Plitvica trail (9km) - both of which start and end at Labudovac Lake. Panoramic views abound on both walks, the paths leading you\n\n## Two days\n\nThe first day should be spent making your way around the Plitvice Lakes. Wake up early and have breakfast on a terrace as you listen to the majestic birdsong that brings the morning woods to life. Take a packed lunch and head out to the main area of the park to walk around the 18km-long wooden footbridges, making sure you take in the Veliki Slap and all of the upper and lower lakes. Don't miss a visit inside the Šupljara cave for a glimpse of the underground life. Since a\n\n## Three days\n\nDay three should be spent hiking up to one of the three peaks of the national park: Oštri Medveđak, Tupi Medveđak or the Turčić peak. The latter is the shortest option, at 1½ hours, whereas the Medveđak hikes take around 2½ hours each. These are light hikes for the most part and they can easily be enjoyed in a day. You'll need to take all food and water with you. The hikes take you through beech and maple forests, and it's a good idea to bring along through centennial forests and valleys that abound with wildlife and various plant species, and you can look out for a variety of butterflies and birds, and even spot a wild beast if you're lucky. You can do the walks alone or go with a park ranger. Head back to the park's centre to enjoy dinner under the stars, set to a soundtrack of frogs, insects and hooting owls.\n\nbinoculars to give yourself the best chance of spotting woodpeckers, butterflies and other fauna. The views from Oštri Medveđak are incredible, giving you the sight of valleys of the Korana River and of neighbouring BosniaHercegovina's Una River, a beautiful, glimmering stream that snakes through lush forests. Getting to the Tupi Medveđak peak is even more rewarding: from here, six of the Plitvice Lakes can be seen from above. The Turčić peak, although the lowest, offers you the sight of Kozjak Lake and the Veliki Slap from the top, as well as vistas of the surrounding mountain ranges. The best time to hike is early spring and especially autumn, when the leaves change colour and the beech and maple forests paint the landscape in glorious reds and golds. Head back down into the park and, if you have the energy, rent out a rowing boat to cap off the day by taking in the view of the lakes at dusk.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-198 -->\n\nGetty Images | Ulla Lohmann/LOOK-foto\n\nPort-Cros National Park\n\n## 45 FRANCE\n\nTwo islands and a swathe of deep-blue sea, PortCros National Park in southern France is postcard Mediterranean paradise.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-199 -->\n\n1\n\n-r\n\nF rom the mainland, Port-Cros, Porquerolles and Le Levant seem to shimmer in the distance. It's the mica-rich rock of these three small islands off the French Côte d'Azur that has given them their name of Îles d'Or (Golden Islands). Port-Cros and most of Porquerolles now make up Port-Cros National Park, a marine and terrestrial park. The park is a concentrate of Mediterranean beauty: crystal-clear waters, beaches of fine sand, magnificent pines and fragrant scrubs, the air filled with the song of cicadas in summer. The northern shores of both islands are characterised by sandy beaches and sheltered coves, whereas the southern coasts feature cliffs and rugged terrain and are much more exposed to the swell and wind.\n\nThere are no cars on either island, although Porquerolles is criss-crossed by a series of wide tracks perfect for cycling. Port-Cros, on the other hand, has just a few buildings and then nothing but 30km of trails and glorious landscapes. The sea is equally serene, with boats required to limit their speed and nary a jet ski in sight. Most visitors are day trippers from the mainland, so staying in the park overnight offers a unique experience. (However, it's expensive and requires advance booking.)\n\nBoth islands have been settled since at least Roman times (even earlier for Porquerolles), although most of the historical sights (forts mostly) date from the 17th century onwards. The islands were bastions of piracy before Louis XIV, and later Napoleon Bonaparte, used their military might to weed out undesirable residents. Over the course of the 20th century, agriculture and tourism emerged as the islands' new raison d'être.\n\nNowadays the national park is beloved by the French, but foreign visitors remain a minority - now's your chance to get in on this Mediterranean secret.\n\n↓ Cycling is one of the best ways to get around flat Porquerolles. Previous page: the turquoise waters of a Port-Cros bay.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go\n\nDue to school holidays, July and August are peak season. June and September are probably the best months to visit, with warm weather and fewer visitors. Winter is very quiet, with limited boat services.\n\n## Getting there\n\nThe park is located on France's southern coast; it comprises a swathe of the Mediterranean and two islands, Port-Cros and Porquerolles, accessible by boat from Hyères (one hour and 20 minutes, respectively). The nearest international airport is Toulon-Hyères, next to Hyères port.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n17/29\n\nLand/marine area covered (sq km)\n\n350\n\nPermanent inhabitants\n\nShipwrecks in the park\n\n6\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-200 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\nLe Mas du Langoustier\n\nLocated on Porquerolles, this glamorous boutique hotel goes back to the days when the island was run as an agricultural estate, as the nearby vineyards attest. Set amid 40 hectares of scented Mediterranean greenery, with access to an idyllic cove, the Langoustier prides itself on its creature comforts - a beautiful pool, a Michelin-starred chef, a helipad (yes), spa treatments and glorious views: if you want to do the national park in style, this is the place to come. Open May to September.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Snorkelling on Port-Cros\n\nPort-Cros is first and foremost a marine national park, so what better way to explore it than by going snorkelling? The park has an underwater trail for visitors to discover the island's wonderful marine life. It is marked by buoys and takes about 40 minutes to complete. There are six stops with explanatory panels; you can also pick up a leaflet about fauna and flora at the Maison du Parc in the village (where there's also snorkelling gear for hire).\n\n## Cycling on Porquerolles\n\nWith its relatively flat terrain and well-maintained tracks,\n\n## Le Manoir\n\nIn a charming 19th-century building, this lovely establishment (one of just three on the island of Port-Cros) feels like a cross between a family pension and a boutique hotel. The rambling gardens are divine and the restaurant is sumptuous too. Open May to September.\n\n## L'Oustaou\n\nIf you want to get a sense of what island life is like, you can't beat this lovely guesthouse. Located in the village on the island of Porquerolles, it is the only establishment open year-round. It also runs a restaurant.\n\nPorquerolles was made for cycling. Tracks wind through fragrant pine forests, scrubland and vineyards and along dreamy coves and beaches. The tourist office has signposted four circuits ranging from 6km to 15km.\n\n## Wine tasting on Porquerolles\n\nNot your typical national-park activity, but so typical of the region! The island has three vineyards, which produce mostly rosé wines. They all offer tastings, although advance booking is usually required. You can, of course, buy the local vintages too.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nPort-Cros National Park is a pocket jewel of Mediterranean climate, fauna and flora. It's sunny year-round, with mild winters and hot summers. Port-Cros is mountainous, while Porquerolles is more level. The dominant vegetation is maquis, a mixture of hardy scrub, Aleppo pines and evergreen oaks. Underwater, the park is best known for its posidonia oceanica (seagrass) meadows, which play a crucial role in Mediterranean biodiversity. Fish and molluscs are abundant, and it's not unusual to see dolphins and whales.\n\nBLACK SCORPIONFISH This fearsome-looking fish usually hangs out near the sea floor to make the most of its camouflage. The spikes on its dorsal fin are poisonous, so don't get too close.\n\nFAN MUSSEL One of the largest seashells in the world, this mollusc likes to nestle among the seagrass. Its byssus (the tuft of filaments at its base) is said to have been used to make the golden fleece.\n\nCICADA From June to August, the song of this dark, longwinged insect fills the air. For many, this is the sound of summer. Find cicadas on tree trunks and branches.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-201 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Circuit de Port-Man, Port-Cros\n\nA four-hour hike, this route takes in the secluded Baie de Port-Man in the east of the island and a number of historic buildings.\n\n## 02 Sentier des Crêtes, Port-Cros\n\nThis demanding threehour walk in the steep western half of the island culminates on Mount Vinegar (196m) and features great views of the rugged southern coastline.\n\n## 03 Sentier des Plantes, Port-Cros\n\nAn aromatic (and steep) 4.5km option, this trail winds its way past the park's signature plants wild lavender, euphorbia, mimosa, rosemary and the like - and offers stupendous views.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-202 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nLearn your seagrass from your algae, wine and dine in superb settings, give your legs a workout on foot and by bike - it's all on just two French Mediterranean islands.\n\n- ↓ Hikers will find interesting terrain matched with serene ocean views on the north coast of Port-Cros. ↓ A shoal of salema porgy; the park has superb snorkelling, including a specially marked underwater trail.\n\n## A day, Port-Cros\n\nAs you get off the boat, pop into the Maison du Parc (national-park office) to buy a map of the island and hire some snorkelling equipment in one of the dive shops.\n\nfor centuries). Bring a picnic (and plenty of water) and break off at the secluded Baie de PortMan (popular with private boats).\n\nHead inland on the Circuit de Port-Man (orange trail) towards Fort de l'Estissac and Fort de l'Eminence. This four-hour hike across the island will give you a wonderful overview of its natural as well as historical heritage (because of the island's location, the French have used it as a military base\n\nThe path then follows the northern coast back towards the village, via the exquisite Plage de la Palud, where you can put on your snorkel and explore the park's underwater trail.\n\nIt's a 30-minute walk back to the port, where you should sit down for a well-earned drink at a terrace before hopping back on the boat.\n\n## A day, Porquerolles\n\nThe first thing you should do is hire a bike - Porquerolles wouldn't be Porquerolles without cycling! Get a map of the island at the tourist office and pedal off on the three-hour blue circuit towards the western half of the island.\n\nThe route takes in the vineyards and two fabulous beaches: the Plage d'Argent and the Plage du Langoustier. Plan a rest (including a swim!) at the latter, which is roughly halfway on the circuit. On your way back to the village, stop at Domaine\n\nPerzinsky for wine tasting (and purchasing!). You could have lunch in the village if you wish, or if you've planned a picnic, cycle on to your afternoon destination, the exquisite Plage de Notre-Dame (20 minutes' cycling). The beach is a fine arc of white sand fringed by pines and is the perfect setting for a couple of hours of sunbathing, swimming and contemplation. Make sure you leave enough time to cycle back to the village and return your bicycle before getting back on the boat.\n\n## Four to five days, both islands\n\nSpending four to five days in the park means that you'll get to experience both islands after the day trippers have gone, a treat few visitors enjoy.\n\nOn day one, catch an afternoon boat to Porquerolles and book yourself in for a couple of nights at Le Mas du Langoustier. Spend the rest of the afternoon and early evening enjoying the glorious setting.\n\nOn day three, head to Port-Cros. In July and August, there are direct boats; the rest of the year, you'll need to head back to the mainland first. Check in at Le Manoir and head out to the Plage de la Palud for the afternoon and swim the underwater trail wearing your snorkel.\n\nHire a bicycle on the second day and pedal around the eastern half of the island (yellow trail).\n\nOn the fourth day, explore the Sentier des Crêtes before spending the rest of the afternoon by the pool or at the beguilingly beautiful Plage du Sud. Head back to the mainland on day five.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-203 -->\n\n## 46 FRANCE\n\nPyrenees National Park\n\nFrance's Pyrenees National Park is a mountain kingdom of craggy peaks and lush valleys where birds of prey soar overhead and surefooted chamois roam the rocky slopes.\n\nGetty Images | Sasha64f\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-204 -->\n\n[:\n\n“\n\nوا‎\n\n\"\n\n7\n\n.\n\n7\n\n—\n\nEw ii\n\ni\n\n۶۳\n\n1\n\n1\n\nr\n\nकि\n\n۳\n\n۴\n\n:\n\n‵l\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-205 -->\n\nO lder than the Alps, the French Pyrenees offer a portal into one of the great unblemished wilderness regions of Western Europe. Come for a weekend foray here and you'll be awed by the dramatic scenery: alpine lakes, glacier-carved valleys and windswept heights that offer startling views over this mountainous landscape of southern France. For the French (and neighbouring Spanish and Andorrans), the Pyrenees have long been an adventureloving playground: with white-water rafting in spring; trekking, horse riding and mountain biking in summer; and skiing in winter - perhaps followed by a rejuvenating soak in a hot spring.\n\nThe hiking here is famous, and you'll agree that that's rightly so when you contemplate a day's outing on one of the park's myriad trails. The modern world slowly disappears into the rear-view mirror on the drive to the trailhead. Then you disembark, the crunch of well-packed dirt underfoot as you wind your way along a curving path through wild flowers lit by the sun and flittering swallowtail butterflies, a great-winged griffon vulture spinning slowly overhead. The rewards of a day's exertion: picnicking beside crystal-clear lakes glittering like jewels amid a cradle of soaring peaks, or reaching the summit of a rocky peak where all the world seems to stretch out beneath you.\n\nYet there's much more to the Pyrenees than its varied terrain for outdoor activities. Dozens of small villages lie scattered around the park's valleys, and old-fashioned industries like cheesemaking are still part of the Pyrenean way of life. Indeed, you may find your passage temporarily blocked as enormous flocks of sheep trundle across\n\nthe road from one field to another. Come in June and you may even stumble upon the transhumance, an age-old practice by which shepherds drive their flocks to high pastures for prime summer grazing.\n\n- ↓ Cheese made from unpasteurised ewe's milk in a cellar in the village of Laruns.

As an added bonus, these two Pyrenean resorts also have appealing hot springs. There's nothing quite like the refreshing warmth of a steaming thermal pool after a day's skiing.\n\n## Rafting\n\nThe Gave d'Ossau, Gave d'Aspe and Gave d'Oloron are three\n\n3km south of Accous, which offers five floral rooms and a cosy family gîte .

This is an adventurer's playground, offering adrenaline-fuelled rides with jaw-dropping views of the valleys laid out before you. Many resorts open their trails to mountain bikers, and well-signed sentiers balisés (marked trails) provide endless action for the VTT ( vélo tout terrain ) crowd.\n\n## What to spot...\n\n↓ Transhumance in action; sheep are moved to higher summer grazing pastures.\n\nLower elevations are covered in fir, beech and pine forest, while the subalpine slopes feature birch and mountain ash, and flowering species like the lily, rhododendron and purple Pyrenean iris. Above 2400m, the alpine landscape is largely bare save for poppies, hardy lichens and the odd dwarf willow. Some 70 animal species (plus 300 butterfly species) inhabit this varied terrain, from the tiny, molelike Pyrenean desman to the brown bear, with golden eagles and vultures (including the rare Egyptian vulture) soaring overhead.\n\nGRIFFON VULTURE Soaring over the valleys, the massive vautour fauve with its wingspan of up to 2.8m is an aweinspiring sight (its scavenger's diet of animal carcasses is somewhat less so).\n\nPYRENEAN CHAMOIS The isard (as it's called in French) is a horned goat-antelope with a russet-brown coat and dark eye patches.

Treat yourself to a quick peek at the soaring spires of the Sanctuaires Notre-Dame de Lourdes, and assemble a picnic hamper at the town's sprawling cast-iron market before hopping in the car for the scenic drive south. The first stop is the Parc Animalier des Pyrénées, where you can spy giant otters, ibex, wolves and other native creatures in a protected mountain setting.\n\nAfterwards, continue to Pont d'Espagne for some spectacular mountain hikes. Take the trail to Lac de Gaube for jaw-dropping views of a sparkling lake surrounded by chiselled peaks. Have your picnic there amid the grand alpine landscape. It's a short trip from there down to Cauterets, a pleasant village and a fine base for the night. In the morning, have a refreshing soak in thermal waters at Cauterets' Thermes de César before heading on winding roads through mountain passes\n\n## A week\n\nStart this scenic ramble across the mountains in the pleasant city of Pau, well situated near the western edge of the park. After taking in Pau's fine Renaissance castle (the birthplace of Henri IV), make the drive to the Vallée d'Aspe, the westernmost of the park's six mountain valleys. Hike one of the many trails near Bedous, then visit one of the folk museums in the valley - among our favourites is Les Fermiers Basco-Béarnais, where you can sample cheese to the wondrous Pic du Midi, an observatory reached by cable car that affords some of the most breathtaking views in the Pyrenees from its 2877m-high perch. Have lunch at the restaurant there, then continue to Le Donjon des Aigles, with an 11th-century chateau and a refuge containing one of the world's largest collections of birds of prey. Afterwards, treat yourself to a feast at the gastronomic hideaway (with guesthouse) of Le Viscos in St-Savin, before ending the trip back in Lourdes on the following morning.\n\nmade from the milk of local ewes, goats and cows.

T\n\nYet remote this wilderness is. More significantly for nature-lovers, it's also pristine. Europe's most intact mixed forest cloaks the lower slopes. Higher up, the trees give way to a stunning series of cerulean tarns, clustered below peaks and ridges regularly cresting the 2300m contour.\n\nThe Retezat Mountains are generally seen as the diamonds in the Carpathian jewel box. The striking landscape has given rise to a rich vein of legend - giants that smite mountaintops in rage and dragons that lay waste to vegetation, leaving only rock in their wake - but the drier geological explanation is that this landscape took shape after huge quantities of snow and ice were deposited during the Pleistocene era. Glaciers chiselled out the gorges, caves, craters and lakes that distinguish Retezat today. It became a national park in 1935; Unesco biosphere reserve status arrived in 1979. One part of Retezat - Gemenele Scientific Reserve - is so protected that there is no public access whatsoever.\n\nThere's a lot to protect, and Romania's rigour in so doing means a star cast of animals, including the grey wolf, brown bear, lynx, chamois and otter, is present in the park. But the lakes festooning this massif provide the most obvious eye candy, filled with summit snow-melt and reflecting the park in stark, moody symmetry. Romania's biggest glacial lake, Bucura, is the most visited, but across the year there are some 80 glacial bodies of water hereabouts. As you camp lakeside, with the wind singing through the boulder fields, the call of the wild is as near and clear as this continent gets.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Snow lingers on Retezat's mountains until mid-June, when trails become accessible and rhododendrons set the slopes ablaze. Almost immediately the crowds (not large) arrive, but by September they're declining and the weather remains clement.\n\n## Getting there\n\nSequestered away in Romania's rural southwest, Retezat is closest to airports Timişoara (west) and Cluj-Napoca (north); the latter is the country's second-largest. Petroşani, with rail and bus links, is the park's gateway town.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n362\n\nArea covered, including buffer zone (sq km)\n\n2509\n\nHighest peak: Peleaga (m)\n\n900-\n\n1300\n\nAnnual precipitation (mm)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-210 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Cabana Pietrele to Pelegea loop\n\nA 22km initiation into the park's best-of, this trail includes a visit to Lake Bucura (where you can camp) and the summiting of Peleaga, from where you'll appreciate why Retezat's smorgasbord of lakes, sparkling below, get called 'God's eyes'.\n\n## 02 Lake Bucura to Retezat peak\n\nThis 10km out-and-back goes from Bucura Lake campsite to the iconic 'cutoff' peak that lends the park its name.\n\n## 03 Poiana Pelegii to Bucura Lake\n\nA 6km out-and-back trail, this is probably the easiest means of experiencing a hike that includes the park's loveliest lake.\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Toomarahva Turismitalu\n\nThis is about as high end as hotels come out in the wilds of Retezat (in all honesty, it's the only hotel). In the jaws of Buta Gorge in the park's southeast, the complex divides itself between a modern building and more traditional log cabins, and it's a popular launchpad for hikes up to Bucura Lake. Its little luxuries, like warm water, wi-fi access, TV and a restaurant, are far from ubiquitous in the park - but the sports pitches are a Retezat one-off. Open year-round.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Hiking\n\nTramping through ancient forests, you emerge into a striking glacial landscape: lunar-like boulder fields bejewelled by lakes, punctured with calderas and crested by some of Eastern Europe's most extensive high-altitude mountain country. The treks from Poiana Pelegii or Cabana Pietrele chalets up to Bucura Lake and then Peleaga are Retezat at its most ravishing.\n\n## Lakeside camping\n\nCamping up at Bucura Lake, the largest glacial lake in Romania, is a Retezat rite of passage. The mountains sheer up in every direction, mirrored in the glimmering water, and you're perfectly positioned for the park's premium trails.\n\n↓ Nature lovers will find peace in the pristine forests and waterways of Retezat National Park.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nRetezat has a savage climate, with 275 days of snow or ice annually. Bears, wolves and 1000-plus plant species (some 60 endemic) are the fauna and flora highlights.\n\nGREY WOLF Romania has Europe's greatest grey-wolf population by a distance. This largest (but still shy!) member of the canine family uses its long legs to negotiate the thick snow often covering the park.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nHike into Retezat's sublimely beautiful heart, camp at its best lake and scale some surrounding peaks.\n\n## Three days\n\nFrom Petroşani drive 40km northwest on the E79 to Ohaba de sub Piatra, then 16km southwest on road 667A to Cârnic village. Park here to start the 1½hour tramp up to Cabana Pietrele, a pleasant gaggle of chalets in the forest foothills. Your main target for today, the glittering glacial Bucura Lake, is another 6km. But the vistas will take your breath more than the climb, and halfway is the idyllic chalet of Cabana Gentiana (good for beer and snacks). Once camped lakeside (by now the mountainous magnificence has opened up like a Lord of the Rings set), stack boulders around to block out the winds.\n\nTrails to try on day two include those up to Peleaga or Retezat peaks. Weary? Spend tonight in more comfort down at Cabana Pietrele.\n\nOn the last day, when returning from Cârnic, it's worth stopping at the ancient capital of Roman Dacia, Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, on the park's northern edge.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-211 -->\n\nGetty Images | Hans Strand\n\n## 48 SWEDEN\n\nSarek National Park\n\nIn Sweden's north, Sarek's inhospitable mountain peaks, raging rivers, dense woodlands and glaciers challenge experienced trekkers who like to be at one with the wild.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-212 -->\n\nA primordial landscape of glacier-covered mountains, lakes and valleys strewn with erratic rocks, cirques, moraines and drumlins - some of the last vestiges of the most recent ice age to have held northern Sweden in its cold grip Sarek is one of the largest wildernesses in Europe. Stark, sharp shoulders of dark rock rise above the wide Rapadalen valley, its boggy greenery bisected by a tangle of icy waterways as the Rapaätno river surges down from the glaciers of Sarektjåkkå.\n\nThe ice sheets receded from northern Sweden as recently as 10,000 years ago, leaving behind deep, U-shaped valleys that hint at the passage of the moving glacial masses that carved them. The land, as if finally breathing freely after being relieved of its icy burden, is still rising by almost half an inch a year.\n\nAround 8000 years ago, these frozen boreal wastes were settled by nomadic hunters, whose remains - old hearths, dwelling sites and rock paintings of reindeer - are plentiful. These were the ancestors of the present-day Sámi, whose lives revolve around the rhythm of the reindeer herd, as they have done for centuries. Sarek was designated a national park in 1909 and together with three other national parks it makes up the Laponia World Heritage Site, a vast swathe of wilderness that preserves the traditional Sámi way of life. Every year the reindeer follow thousand-year-old migration paths across the valleys of Sarek in search of forage grounds. For the Sámi communities of Tuorpon, Jåhkågaska tjiellde and Sirges, Sarek's calving grounds, foraging areas and reindeer corrals are an essential part of their livelihood. 'Mountain Sámi' move their\n\nherds large distances from the forest to the mountains and back again, while the 'forest Sámi' follow their beasts from wetland to forest.\n\n- ↓ Sarek's wild and mountainous terrain makes it prime hiking country.

July and August bring berry picking and fishing but mosquitoes aplenty. Autumn boasts wonderful colours and clear, cold days. Winter is strictly for snow sports.\n\n## Getting there\n\nSarek stretches along the wild border with Norway in a northern corner of Sweden's Lapland. There are no roads or towns nearby; the only way in is on your own two feet/skis/snowshoes or by helicopter drop.\n\n## Park in numbers\n\n1977 Area covered (sq km)\n\n2089\n\nHighest point: Sarektjåkkå (m)\n\nYears that humans have been active in the park area\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-213 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Camping wild\n\nOne of Sarek's biggest attractions is the liberty to pitch your tent anywhere in the wilderness before you. Whether you choose a splendidly scenic spot at the foot of the mighty Sarektjåkkå or on the banks of a river teeming with fish, you must be completely self-reliant and prepared for the extremes of terrain and volatile weather conditions. Bring plenty of food.\n\n## STF Saltoluokta Fjällstation\n\nIn Stora Sjöfallet National Park at the northern border of Sarek, this\n\n## Do this!\n\nWildlife watching Sarek is the 'Alaska of Europe'. Exploring it with a guide in winter gives you a proper appreciation of its glacial wilderness. Strap on a pair of skis, follow animal tracks in the snow and pitch your tent nightly under the northern lights.\n\n## Ski touring\n\nSarek's vastness, remoteness from civilisation and visits from just a few hundred hikers a year mean that the chances of animal spotting are very high. Bring binoculars and scan the narrow valleys for reindeer; the park doubles as pastureland for several Sámi families. In summer you can see bears with cubs hunting timber building and five satellite guest houses sit on the bank of Stora Lulevatten lake. The restaurant serves northern Swedish specialities, and guided ascents of nearby Lulep Gierkav mountain are on offer.\n\nSTF Kvikkjokk Fjällstation This mountain station has a superb location on the bank of a roaring river near Sarek. The simple rooms and dorms and well-equipped guest kitchens cater to self-sufficient hikers; there's an on-site restaurant.

If you're particularly lucky, you may spot a lynx near the Rittak and Laitaure lakes and in the Rapadalen valley.\n\n## Helicopter trekking\n\nGetting dropped off or picked up by helicopter at the Sarek border of your choice is easily doable in summer with Fiskflyg. En route you get a remarkable aerial view of the narrow glacial valleys, glistening glaciers, dense forest and barren mountains.\n\n## What to spot...\n\n↓ The northern lights provide a spectral backdrop to any Sarek hike.\n\nSarek is distinguished by its brief, warm summers and dark, harsh winters, when temperatures drop to -40°C. Habitats include subarctic forests, taiga, glaciers, mountains, and alpine rivers and grasslands. Ample precipitation means that wading-bird species thrive, while golden eagles nest in the mountains. Diurnal mammals like reindeer, brown bears and unusually large moose roam the remote valleys, while predators such as lynx, wolverine, the critically endangered grey wolf and the Arctic fox hunt by night.\n\nEURASIAN LYNX Europe's largest cat is a nocturnal, extremely efficient hunter that can bring down prey much larger than itself - mainly reindeer. Cubs accompany their mother on hunts from the age of three months.\n\nBROWN BEAR Sweden's largest predator subsists mostly on roots, plants and berries, as well as moose and rodents. Brown bears hibernate from October until May. Keep your distance in summer, when they have cubs.\n\nARCTIC FOX Found in remote, mountainous areas, Arctic foxes live in large family groups in underground dens. They prey on rodents and their thick white fur allows them to camouflage themselves well against the snow.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-214 -->\n\n## See this...\n\n01 Rapadalen Numerous ribbons of steelgrey water wind their way along the wide valley floor between craggy, bare cliffs, snow-capped mountains and countless oxbow lakes.\n\n02 Kåtokkaskatjåkkå One of Sarek's more accessible mountains and the park's most picturesque peak, Kåtokkaskatjåkkå has a vast cirque glacier spilling down from its summit and feeding a tributary of the Rapaätno river.\n\n03 Pårtetjåkkå Ice fields cover the steep flanks of one of the tallest mountains in Sarek (2005m), with a cluster of pristine oxbow lakes in the valley below.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-215 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nBe an intrepid explorer by heading into uncharted wilderness, fording icy rivers, revelling in the lack of trails and relying on no one but yourself.\n\n↓ Every year, reindeer follow thousand-year-old migration paths through the park in search of foraging grounds.\n\n## Four or more days\n\nStarting in Kvikkjokk, just outside Sarek, this is the easiest way to taste the Sarek wilderness without getting lost, as it follows a 73km stretch of the 440km Kungsleden (King's Trail) through part of the park. From Kvikkjokk, hike north through pine forest until you reach a large lake. Skirt its western side and stay overnight in a cabin at Pårtestugan. You're in Sarek proper now, and the day's hike will take you across bare, mountainous terrain, with excellent views of the Pårtetjåkkå and\n\nKåtokkaskatjåkkå massifs to your left. You'll reach the vast Laitaure lake, which you cross using the rowing boats provided. Here you can use the cabin at Aktse as a base for venturing off the trail and into the wilds of Sarek's Rapadalen valley, home to numerous elk and bears. In the valley mouth you can camp around the many oxbow lakes and branches of the river for a couple of days before making your way back to Aktse and trekking north across a boggy stretch of land, with wooden\n\n## Two weeks\n\nA real off-the-beaten track adventure, this 200km, two-week hike stays largely within the boundaries of Sarek. You'll be completely off the grid and venturing into the wilderness with no trails and no mobile-phone coverage, so compass, map and GPS are essential. The only thing you don't have to worry about is water.\n\nStart the trek in Kvikkjokk, the closest settlement to Sarek's borders, and head into the mountains bordering Sarek to the south by following the river valley west and boardwalks to help you across. Traverse another lake using the boat service run by a caretaker to the cabin in Sitojaure. From here, it's a steep descent to the village of Saltoluokta, a short bus ride away from the town of Gällivare.\n\nskirting the southern flank of Tarrekaise mountain (1829m). It'll take at least two days' hike to reach the Sarek border, passing three cabins en route. Then you'll enter Vallevágge valley and spend the next few days making your way across rough terrain in between bare Sarek massifs. Head east towards the mighty Pårtetjåkkå peak, and then continue north into Njåtjosvagge, a narrow glacial valley. Be prepared to ford several tributaries of the main river. Passing a string of lakes, and skirting yet another massif, head north towards the vast Alkajaure lake before following the course of the Rapaätno river around the northern side of the glacier-topped Akkatjåkko mountain. Keep to the right side of the river until you reach the confluence of the Rapaätno and another river. To finish, head south into the spectacular Rapadalen until the mighty Rapaätno dissolves into myriad waterways and flows into Laitaure lake. From here, take the Kungsleden back to Kvikkjokk.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-216 -->\n\nSaxon Switzerland National Park\n\nHang out with the rock stars at one of Germany's most soul-stirring national parks, where the sandstone is convoluted and stairways lead to free-climbing heaven.\n\nGetty Images | Franz Waldhäusl\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-217 -->\n\nr\n\n--\n\nー\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-218 -->\n\nou're striding along a forest trail or shimmying up an ironrung ladder through a mossy crevasse when suddenly your gaze lifts to fluted sandstone pinnacles, columns, tabletops and cliffs that rise like the ruins of a fantasy fortress.

In the worldliness below a bruised pink-purple sky.\n\nInspired to paint or write? You're not the first. Creative souls have long extolled the beauty of Saxon Switzerland, and none more famously than the 18th-century Swiss double act that gave it its moniker: Adrian Zingg and Anton Graff. While teaching at Dresden art academy, they fell hopelessly in love with the region that so reminded them of their homeland, Jura. Hot on their heels came inspiration-seeking Romantics, including 19th-century landscape artist Caspar David Friedrich, who thrashed out forbidding paintings of wild, mist-ensnared crags.\n\nStarkly eroded over 100 million years, these rocks might look as porous as honeycomb or as fragile as wax candles, but they've been around since dinosaurs walked the planet. They rose up from the Cretaceous ocean, and the Elbe River has helped to sculpt them into the spires, gorges and mini mesas you see today.\n\nIt's not only geologists who have a field day here. These rocks are the cradle of free climbing - the rules were written right here in the early 20th century - and there are more than 1000 pinnacles to clamber up and jump across (yes, really). Hikers are in their element, too, on trails that plunge deep into citadels of stone, and on tracks that flirt with mountaineering, with rungs\n\n↓ Exploring Saxon Switzerland's sandstone towers.\n\nPrevious page: the Basteibrücke offers a channel through the rocks.\n\nand steps leading up and down millenniaold cliffs like a primeval game of snakes and ladders.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Each season has its charm. Spring and autumn are quieter and bring a splash of colour to the landscape. Crowds peak during summer, prime time for activities like rock climbing, hiking and water sports. Occasional snow dusts the pinnacles in winter.\n\n## Getting there\n\nSaxon Switzerland straddles the Czech border; the closest airport is in Dresden, 50km north. Towns like Bad Schandau, Königstein and Rathen are linked to Dresden by the B172, B6 and A4 roads, and regular trains.\n\n## Park in numbers\n\n93.5 Area covered (sq km)\n\n562\n\nHighest point: Grosser Zschirnstein (m)\n\n1990\n\nYear the park was established\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-219 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Burg Alrathen\n\nIt's not every night you get to stay in a medieval castle. This one in Rathen is the real McCoy, perched on a rocky outcrop and featuring plush, warm-hued digs with pine trappings. Opening onto a panoramic terrace overlooking the Elbe, the restaurant cooks up hearty meals such as pork roast with sauerkraut and dumplings.

Just try to suppress a gasp when you first eye the 19th-century Basteibrücke, a sandstone bridge that leaps photogenically between the bizarre rock formations. Goethe waxed lyrical about this view, and whether seen in swirling mist, snow flurries or dazzling sunshine, it really is something else.\n\nnature by boofen . This practice of sleeping below a rock overhang goes back aeons in Saxon Switzerland.

This grand pile on Bad Schandau's main square delivers. Rooms are slick and contemporary (Elbe-facing ones cost more), and you'll welcome some chill time in the huge rooftop spa after a day on the trail.\n\n## Exploring the Elbe\n\nSnaking through the national park's heart, the Elbe is one of Germany's greatest rivers. Discover it by paddle steamer or rowing boat or by pedalling part of the Elbe Cycle Route.\n\n## Free climbing\n\nSaxony wrote the rulebook on free climbing (no artificial aids; ropes and carabiners only for protection etc), and you can see why. The weathered buttes and pinnacles are a vast playground for climbers, with 17,000 routes, graded I to XII, scrambling up 1100 rocks. Inexperienced? Go with a pro.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nSaxon Switzerland pieces together a jigsaw of habitats: tabletop mountains, deep canyons, moors, primeval forest, plateaus and rugged, rocky terrain. Ferns, mosses and lichens thrive in its cool, damp ecosystem, as do flowers and herbs such as gelbe Veilchen (yellow violet) and Sumpfporst (wild rosemary), which usually only grow in tundra climates. Wildlife thrives in its hard-to-reach corners, including eagle owls, otters, dormice, black storks, peregrine falcons and lynx.\n\nSALMON Dams and diminished water quality decimated the Elbe's once-healthy salmon populations, but they have bounced back. At 1165km, the Elbe is Germany's second-largest river.\n\nEURASIAN EAGLE OWL Bubo bubo is the Latin name for this tufty-eared, mottle-feathered owl with distinctive orange eyes. Females are bigger than males and can have wingspans of nearly 2m. This nocturnal predator likes the cliff ledges and gullies of the park's remoter corners.\n\nEURASIAN LYNX This wildcat prowls park forests. Europe's thirdlargest predator, it is carnivorous (stalking and pouncing on prey) and solitary, and changes its coat from golden-brown to silver-grey in winter.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-220 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Malerweg (Painter's Way)\n\nGot a week to spare?

The Romantic artists longed to paint it, and at the very least you'll want your camera handy, especially when the gracefully loping Basteibrücke slides into frame. Cross it to reach the remnants of a partly reconstructed medieval castle, Felsenburg Neurathen. From here, take a ramble on the circular trail to Schwedenlöcher. Slotted into the cliffs, this mossy ravine is where troops hid from the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War. Count the 818 steps leading to the Amselgrund Valley.\n\nRound out the day with dinner at Bastei Berghotel's restaurant. Snag a window table for views while digging into fish or game paired with local wines. Burg Alrathen's rooms offer fine panoramas and peaceful slumber.\n\nOn the following day, rise early to beat the crowds to Königstein Fortress. Lifted high on a tabletop mountain, 260m above the river, it commands sweeping views\n\n## Four days\n\nFollow the weekend itinerary, then on day three get yourself over to the Schrammsteine first thing - this rocky wonderland of weirdly eroded sandstone formations is most striking in the morning light. The big deal here is the headspinning two-hour hike to Schrammsteinaussicht (417m), which threads along a sandy track, through cool, damp gorges and up a seemingly neverending one-way staircase, the Himmelsleiter (Heaven's Ladder). The\n\nacross Saxon Switzerland's forest of rock pinnacles. The 13th-century citadel looks every inch the fairy-tale castle and is Germany's biggest. Highlights include the Brunnenhaus, with its seemingly bottomless well, and Georgenburg, once Saxony's most feared prison, whose inmates included Meissen porcelain inventor Johann Friedrich Böttger. During WWII, it served as a POW camp. Linger to see sunset backlight the distinctive tabletop mountain of Lilienstein in the distance.\n\nview at the top? Just wow. Here you're just a hair's breadth from the Czech border. Back in Bad Schandau, go for dinner at Barthel's on the Marktplatz - sit on the terrace if weather permits. The kitchen dishes up a gutsy feast of oldfashioned Saxon grub like Sauerbraten (braised beef in spiced vinegar). Spend the night at the spatopped Elbresidenz.\n\nYour last day in the national park presents you with choices. You could walk a chunk of the\n\nMalerweg, contemplating the great Romantic painters who went before you. Or perhaps you'd prefer a spin along the Elbe River by bicycle. If free climbing is more your scene, the park really is your oyster. Pick your pinnacle and go for it. Should you want to feel closer to the elements, spend your final night boofen - wild camping under a rocky overhang, with nothing but the starry night as your curtain.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-222 -->\n\n一\n\n|\n\nÅ\n\ni\n\nå:\n\nבאונים‎\n\n8\n\n﹣\n\n十\n\n|\n\n-\n\n-\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-223 -->\n\nGetty Images | Antonio Luis Martinez Cano\n\nSPAIN\n\nSierra Nevada National Park\n\n50\n\nYou've seen them before: Spain's snowcapped Sierra Nevada mountains provide the much-loved, muchphotographed backdrop to La Alhambra in Granada. But they're even better up close.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-224 -->\n\nH ome to mainland Spain's highest mountain, a miracle of snow rising above the baking plains of Andalucía, the Sierra Nevada is one of Spain's most unlikely attractions. Where else in Europe can you stare up at dazzling snows through a cloud of heat haze? Or be almost guaranteed a sighting of extravagantly horned ibex? Or see almost one-third of Spain's entire portfolio of plant species in one place? Or experience all of these things on the same day?\n\nFormed at the same geological moment as the Alps and Morocco's Atlas Mountains, the Sierra Nevada stretches 75km west to east, and its foothills and high valleys bear echoes of one of Spanish history's grand epics. In 1492, with the Christian armies of the Reconquista in control of Granada, ending eight centuries of Islamic rule in southern Spain, Boabdil, the last Muslim ruler of Al-Andalus, crossed the Sierra Nevada on his way into exile. As he did so, he turned for one last tearful look at his beloved city, only to be scolded by his mother: 'Do not weep like a woman for that which you were unable to defend like a man!' Boabdil and his followers settled in Las Alpujarras, a highaltitude cluster of villages on the southern downslopes of the sierra, villages that even today seem more Arab than European.\n\nAnd in the same way that the Sierra Nevada provides the backdrop to La Alhambra and Granada, so, too, does this history provide backstory to these mountains' excellent selection of activities winter skiing at Europe's southernmost ski station, summer hiking through flora- and fauna-rich high country, as well as horse riding, climbing, mountain biking, paragliding and some seriously good eating.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The mountains are accessible year-round, but the time to go depends on what you want to do. Las Alpujarras are best April to mid-June and mid-September to early November. The ski station is open roughly November to March. High-altitude hiking trails usually open late June to October.\n\nGetting there The park spans the Granada and Almería provinces of Spain's southeast in the triangle between Granada, Málaga and Almería.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n862 Area covered (sq km)\n\n3479\n\nHighest point: Mulhacén (m)\n\n5000\n\nNumber of wild ibex roaming free within the park\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-225 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Carmen de la Alcubilla del Caracol\n\nGranada makes a fine base for visiting the Sierra Nevada, although it's so fabulous that it can be hard to tear yourself away.

Andalucía's largest Spanish ibex population may get most of the attention, but you've also a chance to see wild boars, martens, badgers and, if you're really lucky, European wildcats. Scan the skies also for bird species that include the golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, Eurasian eagleowl and red-legged partridge. Remarkably, the Sierra Nevada boasts close to 2100 of Spain's 7000 plant species, with 60 of these endemic.\n\nSNOW STAR Endemic to the Sierra Nevada, the snow star grows beneath overhanging rocks and in rocky crevasses and cracks. When in flower, it resembles a white starfish.\n\nSPANISH IBEX Also known as the Iberian ibex or Spanish wild goat, the ibex has short legs and flexible hooves that make them perfectly adapted for bare rocky outcrops.

From Capileira you can push on to approach (and then climb) Mulhacén from the south.\n\n## A day\n\nIf you've only allocated a day for the Sierra Nevada, treat it like a reconnaissance mission to help you plan your return - a single day is never enough here. If you're coming from Granada, drive up past the ski station at Pradollano, then on to Hoya de la Mora - to reach here you may need to take the shuttle bus, depending on the season, then either ski back down (in winter) or climb to the top of Mulhacén for immense views, not to mention the cachet of summiting mainland Spain's highest mountain; watch\n\n## Two days\n\nAn extra day, well spent, allows you to deepen your experience of the Sierra Nevada, although be warned: every day that you spend in the area only deepens its hold on you. Stay in any of Las Alpujarras' villages on the first day to soak up the silence and enable an early start. To your ascent of Mulhacén on day one add a hike up its spectacular deputy, Veleta. If climbing two such towering peaks proves too daunting, consider climbing either peak on day one, then\n\n## Three days\n\nOK, now you're talking. Begin in Granada by admiring the Sierra Nevada from afar (with the peerless Alhambra in the foreground, of course), then picture yourself standing on the range's highest point within hours. To make that a reality, take the A395 from the city outskirts to the Mulhacén trailhead. As no roads cross the mountains here, return to sleep in Granada at the end of day one. Early on the morning of day two, rush south along the E902 as far as Tablate, from where the A348 leaves walking the 20km from Lanjarón to Pampaneira on the second day. Shorter day hikes are also possible, while you could expand your vehicular exploration of Las Alpujarras by adding the villages of La Taha sector and throwing in a visit to Trevélez for good measure. The latter's reputation for fine jamón , produced from pigs kept in pristine surroundings, makes it an excellent lunch stop as you continue into the park's southern reaches through the Trevélez gorge.\n\nthe world of haste behind, twisting across the southern flanks of the Sierra Nevada. Wherever you encounter a side road disappearing off to the north, take it. Whenever you find yourself in a beautiful village, park the car to get out and walk. And by the end of day two, make sure you've visited as many villages as you can, and have factored in the Veleta ascent. On day three, leave your wheels in Lanjarón or Pampaneira, then walk between the two.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-228 -->\n\n## 51 SLOVAKIA\n\nSlovenský Raj\n\nGet drenched by waterfalls, cling to ladders and shiver inside an ice cave: exploring Slovakia's Slovenský Raj is not for the faint-hearted.\n\nShutterstock | Milosz\\_M\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-229 -->\n\nN aming this national park 'Slovak Paradise' was no idle boast. A web of crystal-clear streams thrashes through Slovenský Raj, and two dramatic mountain ranges, the Low Tatras and the Slovak Ore Mountains, cradle the park. The Hornád River carves out deep canyons, overlooked by towering beech trees. Rare wolves, wildcats and boar trot silently through the forests that cover 90 percent of the park. With countless waterfalls drawing butterflies to their swirling mists, Slovenský Raj feels like a paradisiacal place indeed.\n\nThe park conceals much beneath the surface, too. Hundreds of caverns are secreted away in limestone cliffs, visited only by bats, while the karst plateaus are pockmarked with sinkholes. The most remarkable subterranean discovery occurred in 1870, when mining engineer Eugen Ruffínyi first slid down into Dobšinská ice cave. This frosty grotto is in a state of eternal winter: warm air cannot percolate down to the cavern, while cold air sinks like a stone through its narrow crevices. Within a year of its discovery, the cave was open for visitors. It remains the most popular sight in Slovenský Raj.\n\nSince the late 19th century, pockets of eastern Slovakia have been ring-fenced for protection. This gradual process created a patchwork of 11 national nature reserves and eight nature reserves, some of the most unspoilt corners of the park. The park's 'paradise' moniker stuck in the early 20th century, though the area wasn't officially classified as a national park until 1988.\n\nToday, more than 300km of hiking routes extend across the park, and cycling trails link its major sights and villages. But the terrain has kept its rough charisma, from\n\n↓ The park's most scenic lookout, Tomášovský Výhľad.

After all, no one ever said paradise was easy.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go May and June bring sunshine, wild flowers and hikers, though crowds truly arrive in July and August. Come in winter for frozen waterfalls and skiing, though hiking options are limited.\n\nGetting there The park is 100km northwest of Slovakia's second city, Košice, along the E50. From Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, take a train to Smižany or Spišské Tomášovce (via Poprad). From Budapest, travel by train via Košice. Airports in Košice and Poprad have direct flights to UK airports.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n197 Area covered (sq km)\n\nNumber of caves and sinkholes\n\n450\n\n70 Height of Závojový, the park's tallest waterfall (m)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-230 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Ranč u Trapera\n\nHorse around in this homely wooden guesthouse with attached stables, located in Hrabušice village in the northern part of the park. Walking trails are only 500m from your door, while in winter you're within easy reach of ski areas like the Levočská Valley. You can arrange a canter on the owner's horses for an extra fee. The location feels as wild and ranch-like as the hotel's name promises, and major park drawcards like the ice cave and Kláštorisko hiking trails are a short hop away.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Ice-cave exploring\n\nWhile most of Slovenský Raj's caves hide from view, you can walk beneath stalactites in Unescolisted Dobšinská ice cave. Find the entrance to this cavern of ice floors and frosty pillars on the north slopes of Duča hill, near the village of Dobšina, and watch your breath turn to mist along 515m of walks (open mid-May to September) - onethird of its total length. And if the setting isn't surreal enough, picture ice skaters pirouetting through the grotto: it was a year-round pastime until the 1940s.\n\n## Penzión Pod Guglom\n\nSlalom to your door at this welcoming guesthouse near Gugel ski area in Mlynky, in the southern part of the park. The on-site sauna soothes stiff muscles, plus there are kid-friendly perks such as play areas, bike hire and a trampoline.\n\n## Park Hotel Čingov\n\nEach of the 20 rooms in this superbly located hotel, on the eastern side of the park, has a balcony overlooking the park or the spiky High Tatras. The vibe is old-fashioned, and menus groan with roasted meat and dumplings drowned in sour cream.\n\n## Skiing\n\nAfter hikers tramp out of Slovenský Raj, skiers arrive. Gugel Mlynky, usually open from January to mid-March, has 5km of runs, including a freeride area and snow park. Wilderness seekers tend to ply its 35km of cross-country trails.\n\n## Cycling\n\nMore than 110km of cycling trails thread the park. From Podlesok, Green Path 3 (6.5km) reaches the Carthusian monastery ruins in Kláštorisko. For a longer ride, Blue Path 4 (20km) zigzags towards the ice cave; turn right onto Green Path 1 at the end.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nShaded woodlands dominate Slovenský Raj, so it's no surprise that 40 species of mammal forage here. Look out for the park's rarer denizens: endangered squirrels and otters at ground level, and the saker falcon soaring above. But much likelier to tiptoe into view are martens, foxes and deer. The few wolves and wildcats prowling through the park will likely bolt at your scent, but look out for their prints, especially in muddy banks along the Hornád River.\n\nBROWN ARGUS BUTTERFLY This chocolate-brown butterfly with amber markings is one of many winged things in Slovenský Raj, which boasts more butterflies than anywhere else in the country. You'll spot them fluttering from May until September.\n\nSAKER FALCON Evolution honed this tawny raptor into a killing machine, with a powerful beak and a diving speed of up to 360km/h, but only small birds need fear its beady glare. Slovenský Raj is one of its few remaining European habitats.\n\nPINE MARTEN Bright eyed, bushy tailed, with pointed ears and downy brown bodies, these omnivorous mammals scamper through Central Europe's woodlands. They're plentiful in Slovenský Raj, where they have river fish, birds and fruit to nibble.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-231 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Suchá Belá The park's most popular gorge makes a scenic twohour hike from Podlesok along 4km of moss-lined rocks and wooden stairs you'll need a good sense of balance.\n\n02 Prielom Hornádu This river canyon is exhilarating but not for the timid: over roughly four hours, you'll grapple 12km of climbing irons and ladders, from Hrdlo Hornádu in Podlesok to Maša Bridge.\n\n03 Veľký Sokol circuit Only hardened hikers should attempt this 21km round-trip.

Summer tours take you into this sub-zero grotto, where 110,100 cubic metres of ice are amassed into gleaming\n\n## A day\n\nSee the national park's icons in the space of a day: you just need your own wheels and a thirst for adventure. Drive into the park from the northeastern entrance through Hrabušice village, in the Podlesok area. From here, embark on one of the park's most beauteous walks: Suchá Belá gorge. The journey involves chains, ladders and footbridges, so expect to emerge river splashed, mud streaked and elated. You'll get wetter in spring or autumn, when the waterfalls are at their most spectacular. We don't\n\n## Four days\n\nDrive into Podlesok (or take a bus from Poprad to Hrabušice) for four days of waterfalls, ruins and stellar hikes. Start with one of the park's favourite treks, to Suchá Belá, followed by a meal back in the village. A few guesthouses here offer horse-riding; check in (you'll need two nights) and spend your afternoon riding around fields of daisies.\n\nThe next day, swap your steed for a rental bike. From Podlesok, pedal along Blue Path 1 (about 20km), stopping at Vernár village for lunch. Continue the turrets, and icicles drip from the walls. From here you can drive south out of the park, but you might want to stop to see Palcmanská Maša, the park's largest reservoir, glowing in the sunset, with views of pretty Dedinky village across the water.\n\nIf, in the golden light, you realise a day wasn't enough in Slovenský Raj, Dedinky is a fine starting point for excursions to the park's southern reaches, while nearby Mlynky is a superb base for winter sports.\n\ntrail towards Krivian, then cycle south via Green Path 1, which leads to Dobšinská ice cave. After your visit, take an alternative route back to Podlesok, scenic Blue Path 4.\n\nOn day three, pack a light overnight bag and set out for Kláštorisko's crumbling Gothic monasteries, via the hour-long Prielom Hornádu trail. Spot seven waterfalls along the way. Spend the afternoon exploring 14th-century monk's cells and the haunting 'symbolic cemetery', which commemorates climbers and other adventurers who died in the park. You can spend the night in cabins here (open in summer only).\n\nAwakening in Kláštorisko puts you at the centre of some of the park's very best hiking routes for your last day. Experienced hikers should start early and trek north along Red Trail 4, then east along Blue Trail 2 to the park's most scenic lookout, Tomášovský výhľad. Just be sure to leave energy for the final hour clambering back from Kláštorisko to your starting point in Podlesok.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-233 -->\n\nLonely Planet | David Noton\n\nSnæfellsjökull National Park\n\nAn array of Iceland's most captivating features, Snæfellsjökull promises all the trappings of the 'Land of Fire and Ice' at the tip of a mesmerising peninsula.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-234 -->\n\nL ush fjords, haunting volcanic peaks, dramatic sea cliffs, sweeping golden beaches, and crooked, crunchy lava flows make up the diverse and fascinating landscape of the 100km-long Snæfellsnes Peninsula. The area is crowned by the glistening ice cap Snæfellsjökull, immortalised in Jules Verne's fantasy tale Journey to the Centre of the Earth . In his proto-sci-fi tale, the brooding ice mound covers a massive volcano whose magma chamber doubles as the gateway to the planet's core. And although the author never travelled to the mountain himself, news of Snæfellsjökull's majesty was undeniable, and it captured both his attention and his imagination.\n\nSnæfellsjökull and its surrounding area - now a national park - have been immortalised in literary works for over a thousand years. Several of Iceland's most crucial sagas - legends captured in the writings of the island's first settlers - took place among the peninsula's lava fields. Stories of battling trolls and seafaring adventurers originated here and helped form the modern conception of Norse history. It was along the shores of the Snæfellsnes that the first Europeans embarked on expeditions to the Americas, their achievements proven by compelling archaeological evidence gathered on the banks of Canada's Newfoundland. Christopher Columbus, reportedly aware of the Icelanders' accomplishments, is said to have stopped within the preserve's confines to seek navigational advice while planning his famous voyage to the New World.\n\nToday, New Age practitioners attribute Snæfellsjökull National Park's millennium of veritable fame to the energy and\n\nmagnets tucked away below the Earth's surface - like a planetary chakra akin to those of Sedona (Arizona) and Ubud (Bali). Some visitors come to Hellnar to feel the intangible forces of nature and rebalance their minds. For others, the reserve casts a much simpler spell: Arctic vistas so compelling that you'll be frozen in awe, unable for a moment or two even to photograph the splendour before you.\n\n↓ Lava fields line the landscape in front of Snæfellsjökull volcano.

The 10 rooms at the Egilsen occupy a lovingly restored timber house - once owned by a wealthy Danish merchant - that creaks in the most endearing of ways when the fjord winds come howling off the bay. The perfect amount of rustic Scandinavian charm (wooden slatting and handwoven quilts) is effortlessly married with stylish accent pieces (copper lamps and a flashy yellow runner up the stairs), as though Jonathan Adler and Martha Stewart have had an Icelandic baby. Heaping portions of homemade breakfast sweeten the deal.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Hot-spring swimming\n\nWading through piping-hot water is practically Iceland's national pastime, and these 'hot pots' are everywhere - from downtown Reykjavík to the isolated fjords of the north. Head to Lýsuhólslaug, a swimming pool at the local primary school that taps into a natural artery of steaming liquid. The pool has a green tint from the algae that thrives in the gurgling carbonated waters you'll emerge with glowing, dolphinlike skin after a relaxing dip.\n\n## Horse riding\n\nThe Icelandic horse is a special breed of equine that bears\n\n## Hótel Buðir\n\nWindswept, lonely and incredibly romantic, Buðir is the fjord-side bolthole of your dreams, complete with baronial furniture, infinite views and an incredible dinner menu of local cuisine served in the candlelit dining room.\n\n## Icelandair Hotel Reykjavík Marina\n\nFor those basing themselves in the capital, this boutique establishment in a converted factory is a fine choice. It sits right along the harbour in the middle of town, offering fjord views, sleek nautical-themed decor and a hip cocktail bar in the lobby.\n\nmany noticeable differences from other horses, including its stout pony-like stature and two extra gaits in addition to the walk, trot, canter and gallop. Visit Lýsuhóll, just a hop beyond the park's southwestern boundary, for a chance to trot along the barren beaches nearby.\n\n## Snowmobiling\n\nWhen the moody weather mellows over the crown of the glacier, you can explore the snowy expanse by snowmobile or snowcat. Tours are based out of the township of Arnarstapi and run during the warmer months of the year.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nIceland's harsh landscape, bombarded by Arctic winds and seismic blasts nearly without respite, makes a relatively inhospitable environment for living creatures. The country has a noticeable dearth of trees and is home to only a handful of mammals, but several species of migratory bird pass through.\n\nTERN The beautiful white tern, with a black cap and a red beak, is notorious for swooping at humans who are nearing its nest. If you spot one, defend yourself by holding a walking stick (or similar) above your head.\n\nGUILLEMOT Making its home along the jagged cliff walls at the tip of the peninsula, the guillemot nests in large groups. In breeding season, each female lays a single egg within the craggy escarpments.\n\nGREY SEAL Considerably larger than the common (or harbour) seal, the grey seal grows to around 3m in length and is most frequently found in Iceland's west and north.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-236 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Hellnar to Arnarstapi This 2.5km walk passes frozen lava flows and eroded caves once home to saga heroes.

Along the way you'll score a sampling of what the park has to offer, but beware: once your appetite is whetted you'll regret that you only have a single day to explore. Start on the southern stretch of the peninsula's Rte 54, where the land is low and the beaches are broad. Just before entering the park, try an hour of horseback riding at Lýsuhóll, followed by a dip in a neighbouring geothermal pool to soothe your weary muscles after all that galloping through the lava fields. Park at Arnarstapi for a 40-minute cliff-side hike to Hellnar, spotting birds nesting among the ochre earth, then drive into the heart of the national park for another short stroll down to the pebble-strewn shore of Djúpalónssandur. In the summer months, a hearty fish stew awaits in the northern recesses of the park at Gamla Rif, a cafe run by two fishermen's wives. Spot\n\n## Three days\n\nWith a long weekend of exploration, you'll want to follow the same coastal loop as the day-long itinerary, but you'll be able to move much more slowly as you venture off the pavement and into the hidden, forest-like expanses of craggy lava. Start on the northern side of the peninsula, basing yourself at Hótel Egilsen in Stykkishólmur. On your first day, swing by Leir 7, a local ceramicist's studio where the artist uses clay from the nearby fjord, then see the Library of Water, the small church bearing an elaborate painting that depicts Christopher Columbus' reputed voyage to the peninsula to gather information from the local Norsemen about their journeys to the New World. Continue along the northern track of Rte 54 as the central peninsular ridge towers above like the spine of a stegosaurus. Pull into the charming village of Stykkishólmur for the night, staying at Hótel Egilsen.\n\nan art installation housing tubes of glacial liquid. Hit Grundarfjörður to try one of the whale-watching excursions with Láki Tours that follow the peninsular coast in search of orca pods (the best months are January to April, during which you can see hundreds of orcas on a single trip).\n\nSpend your second day solely within the park's official boundaries by zipping along Jules Verne's infamous glacier by snowmobile, then traipsing below the surface on a guided tour of the park's\n\nWater Cave. Don't miss a hike out to the peninsular tip at Öndverðarnes, where birdlife thrives among the inhospitable cliffs. As Rte 54 ploughs beyond the preserve's borders, diversions include horse riding, hot-spring bathing and a rocky ledge covered with blubbery sunbathing seals. Hótel Buðir is just beyond, with a sumptuous dinner menu of delicious local produce, and a lonely black church the size of a postage stamp outside both perfect fodder for your Instagram.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-238 -->\n\nSnowdonia National Park\n\nCarved by glaciers, wrapped in mist and lost in legends, beautiful Snowdonia is as Welsh as Tom Jones, cheese on toast and dragons.\n\n500px | callum wright\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-239 -->\n\nR ugged Snowdonia is the heart and soul of Wales. The rocky Snowdon massif has protected not only unspoilt nature but also a way of life. Two out of three people speak Welsh as their first language in this rugged corner of the British Isles, where the ancient kings of Eryri once held court. It's as firmly tied to the Welsh identity as male voice choirs and Arthurian legend. Indeed, King Arthur is said to have killed a monstrous beard-tugging giant and buried the body somewhere on the summit. Most modern visitors, though, are drawn by the landscapes: big, bold and elemental, the remains of prehistoric volcanoes remodelled by passing glaciers.\n\nUsed as the training ground for the first ascent of Everest, Snowdon is the most climbed mountain in Britain, though for many, the 'climb' is actually a leisurely ride on the rack-and-pinion Mountain Railway. That's the easy route; the hard way is the direct ascent of the cliffs at Clogwyn Du'r Arddu. At 1085m, Britain's second-highest peak has been a testing ground for thrill seekers since 1798, when Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley completed the first recorded rock climb in Britain on the face of old 'Cloggy'.\n\nThe rough-and-ready terrain is far from uninhabited, but there's plenty of proper wilderness, providing a haven for all sorts of endangered critters. Rather amazingly, this all used to be under the sea, as demonstrated by the fossilised seashells that crop up at the summit. There's still plenty of standing water - somewhat inevitable considering the Welsh climate creating still and silent lakes in the bottom of bowls scooped out by prehistoric ice. It's stunningly beautiful in good weather,\n\nand solemn and moody in bad, but you can always retreat to the cafe at the summit for a warm cuppa.\n\n- ↓ Tryfan's rugged summit.\n\nPrevious page: steam trains have chugged their way up Snowdon since 1896.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go\n\nSnowdon in winter is not for the faint-hearted, with strong winds and blankets of snow. Most visitors come in summer, when blue skies are reflected in Snowdon's lakes. Autumn and spring bring fewer crowds, but not less rain, which belts down at these times.\n\n## Getting there\n\nBangor and\n\nCaernarfon are the nearest towns, and domestic flights drop into the tiny airport on nearby Anglesey.

Edmund Hillary and his follow mountaineers set up camp at PenY-Gwryd Hotel, in Nant Gwynant, in 1953 before heading to Nepal, and not a lot has changed since. A gong still announces dinner every night, and memorabilia from the 1953 expedition encrusts the walls. The hotel was built as a farmhouse, but crossed ice axes have been its emblem since the first stones were laid in 1810.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Mountain walking\n\nThere's really no buzz like summiting Snowdon, but how you do it depends on your head for heights. The easiest trail is the 8km Llanberis Path, but this means a crowd. You'll have less company on the 5.6km Watkins Path, but we say go all in, and tackle the 6.5km Crib Goch track, which picks its way along a knife-edge arête, with perilous drops on either side. People have been known to crawl the whole way…\n\n## Riding the railway\n\nNow that the upper station and cafe have been remodelled, riding the Mountain Railway to\n\n## Bryn Gwynant YHA\n\nIf you're serious about summiting Snowdon on foot, this quintessentially Welsh YHA occupies a moody grey-stone mansion on the shores of placid Llyn Gwynant, just a couple of miles from the start of the Watkin Path.\n\n## Coed-y-Celyn Hall\n\nSet in the grand former home of a local slate-mining magnate, these self-catering apartments in Betws-y-Coed are perfect for independent-minded explorers, with a fine location on the edge of the Gwydyr Forest, much loved by walkers and mountain bikers.\n\nthe top of Snowdon feels like an excursion in the Swiss Alps. The rack-and-pinion railway opened in 1896 and charming steam locos still gently push carriages to the summit, offering stunning views all the way.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nOutside the summer months, the paths climbing Snowdon double as mountainbike trails, offering a bone-shaking but undeniably direct route to the valley floor. There's plenty of freewheeling on the way down, but going up is a mix of riding and carrying.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nHill farms sprawl over the Snowdon massif, but the higher ground provides shelter for all sorts of rare Welsh beasties. Scan the skies for peregrine falcons, red kites and rare ospreys, or look out for wild goats gambolling on the slopes - they were domesticated by the ancient Britons but have been running wild here since at least the last ice age. In early summer, seek out the Snowdon lily, an alpine flower that is common in the Alps but incredibly rare in Britain.\n\nPOLECAT These ferret-like mustelids were almost wiped out by Victorian gamekeepers, but two World Wars and legal protection allowed populations to recover. Look out for sinuous shapes scampering around the higher ground.\n\nOTTER Waterlogged Snowdonia is a natural home for the elusive otter, which roams all the way from the high llyns (lakes) to the coast. Your best chances for sightings are at Tal-y-Llyn in the south of the park.\n\nRED KITE The national bird of Wales, the heraldic-looking w can be spotted floating effortlessly on the updrafts that rise over the Snowdon massif; look for the distinctive forked tail.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-241 -->\n\n/.\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Llanberis Path The easiest of the many trails struggling up the slopes of Snowdon, this 8km path tacks alongside the Mountain Railway.\n\n02 Crib Goch path This tough 6.5km track veers off the Pyg Path onto a Grade 1 scramble that becomes increasingly exposed as you gain the razor-thin Crib Goch ridge.\n\n03 Welsh 3000s You'll get to bag the summits of Snowdon and 15 other 3000ft (914m) peaks on this epic 48km trek, completed in a single stint lasting anything from four to 24 hours.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-242 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nClaim the summit of Snowdon, mountain-bike down rocky trails or watch the clouds slide over the mirrored surface of a glacial lake; to know Snowdonia is to love Snowdonia.\n\n↓ A mountain biker grinds his way up Llanberis Path to the summit of Wales' highest peak, Snowdon (1085m). ↓ The ruins of Dolbadarn Castle, which was built in the 13th century by Welsh prince, Llywelyn the Great.\n\n## Two days\n\nEven with just a few days in Snowdonia, you'll be able to bag the summit, but it pays to earn it by coming up here on foot. Start day one with a scenic drive to Bala to enjoy the watery pleasures around Llyn Tegid. This finger-like glacial lake is licked by scouring winds, providing excellent conditions for sailing and windsurfing, and you can rent everything from kayaks to catamarans. Nearby Tryweryn and Dee rivers offer Wales' most reliable white water; the watersports centres at Bala and\n\nFrongoch will strap you into a life vest faster than you can say iechyd da (good health). Continue on to Dolgellau, which boasts the impressive distinction of having the highest concentration of listed buildings in Wales. The Dolgellau Trail will take you on a nostalgic trip past historic wool mills and relics from the short-lived Dolgellau gold rush, or you can drop into the silent depths at the Corris Mine. If you still have energy, the 5.6km Precipice Walk offers sweeping views towards Snowdon and Cader Idris.\n\n## A week\n\nA week opens up all sorts of interesting ways to explore the national park, from mountain trails to the beaches of the Snowdonia coast. Start in Betws-yCoed and devote a day to strolling around local landmarks such as Gwydyr Forest and the Ugly House, built from boulders by bandits, according to local legend. On day two, hit the slopes of Snowdon, walking up via the kneeknocking Crib Goch trail, and down via the Pyg Path or Miners' Track. Take another day in Llanberis\n\nSnowdon gets its chance to shine on day two. From Betws-y-Coed, a favoured destination for Victorian holidaymakers, follow the winding road up to Peny-Pass, starting point for the Pyg Path, Miners' Track and Crib Goch trails to the summit of Snowdon. Which one you choose will depend on your taste for sheer drops and loose scree. At the top, reward yourself with lunch at the summit cafe. Moving on, either scamper down the Llanberis Path or make the trip on the puffing Mountain Railway.\n\nfor a cruise on Llyn Padarn or a ride on the summit railway, and an afternoon at the more-exciting-thanit-sounds National Slate Museum, devoted to the tough lives lived by Welsh slate miners. For a more hands-on approach, go for a scuba dive in the village's submerged slate quarry. Slingshot through Caernarfon on day four to complete the circuit of Snowdon and reach Beddgelert, where Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great reputedly buried his dog after a mix-up involving his baby son and a hungry wolf.

Yes, there are a lot of legends in Snowdonia…\n\nFinish your Snowdon odyssey by rolling downhill to Portmeirion, whose kooky pottery factory was the setting for cult TV show The Prisoner, then soak up the salty sea air across the estuary on the beach at Harlech.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-243 -->\n\nShutterstock | Peter Wey\n\nSwiss National Park\n\n## 54 SWITZERLAND\n\nA spectacle of nimble-footed ibex, crevassed glaciers, topaz lakes and dolomitic peaks, the Swiss National Park is a glimpse of the Alps before the dawn of tourism.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-244 -->\n\nS triding in quiet exhilaration through high pastures freckled with wild flowers, suddenly you stop dead in your tracks. Not because of the arresting view of morainestreaked mountains, their summits dappled with honeyed morning light. Not because a podgy marmot has just emerged to keep watch over its rocky burrow. But because you have found the Holy Grail of Alpine flora: edelweiss, the delicate, fuzzy white bloom which folk once risked life and limb to pick for their sweethearts.\n\nEven the most ardent Alpine hiker can go years without clocking edelweiss, but such rarities abound here, where nature is left to its own devices. Perhaps it's the first time you've seen the flower in the wild, but then the Swiss National Park is all about firsts. This was the first national park to be established in the Alps, in 1914, and over a century later it still keeps a tight grip on its conservation ethos: no trees are felled, no meadows are cut, no animals are hunted, and human intervention is scant - almost non-existent.\n\nNudging the Italian and Austrian borders in a remote corner of the Engadine Valley in eastern Switzerland, the park is often hailed as a 'Canada in miniature' - and it lives up to the hype. Whether you're watching ibex leap from rock to rock on the trail to the jewel-like Lakes of Macun, rambling through sapscented forests with the roar of rutting stags echoing through the Val Trupchun, or gazing up to raw, glacier-capped peaks of dolomite, which originated in an ocean 200 million years ago, this pristine pocket of wilderness will linger in your memory long after your footprints and photos have been erased.\n\n↓ A cyclist climbs Umbrail Pass (2501m).

July and August are hiking heaven, with long days and all trails open. Forests kindle into colour in autumn, and midSeptember to early October is stag-rutting season.\n\n## Getting there\n\nThe closest airport is in Zurich, a 2½-hour drive northwest. Frequent trains serve Zernez, S-chanf and Zuoz. Hiking buses provide an eco-friendly means of reaching trailheads.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n170.3 Area covered (sq km)\n\n3174\n\nHighest point: Piz Pisoc (m)\n\nMarked hiking trails (km)\n\n80\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-245 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Chamanna Cluozza\n\nSlip back to nature by overnighting in the park's thickly forested heart. Situated at 1882m, the chalet is basic: there are no showers, and dorms and bunks are bare bones (bring or rent a sleepingbag liner), but the setting in the offthe-radar Val Cluozza is phenomenal. A three-hour walk from Zernez, it's open mid-June to mid-October.\n\n## Hotel Parc Naziunal Il Fuorn\n\nOnce a retreat for smugglers, pack trains and iron-ore miners en route\n\n## Do this!\n\nGuided ranger hikes Sure, you can go it alone, but you might get more out of one of the guided hikes run by the Swiss National Park Visitor Centre in Zernez from late June to mid-October. These skip from Val Trupchun wildlife-spotting treks to high-altitude hikes to the Ofen Pass and Lakes of Macun. Most are in German, but guides usually speak some English. The visitor centre also has a 1:50,000 map covering 21 walks in the park.\n\n## Wildlife spotting\n\nWith a little luck and a decent pair of binoculars, you can\n\nsight some fantastic Alpine wildlife.\n\nHot spots include Alp Stabelchod to the Ofen Pass, this 16th-century inn is now the park's only hotel. The generous-sized rooms are comfy, and the restaurant dishes up grub like game and Capuns (chard-wrapped dried meat) and Spätzle noodles.\n\n## Hotel Bär &amp; Post\n\nGoing strong since 1905 and run by the kindly Patscheider family, this sweet chalet-style hotel in Zernez harbours pine-heavy rooms and a little spa. The restaurant menu swings with the seasons - from Bündner Gerstensuppe (creamy barley soup) to venison with chestnuts.\n\nat 1958m, where you might spot red deer and chamois and almost certainly marmots. Lammergeiers (bearded vultures) can often be glimpsed from the nature trail near Il Fuorn, ibex around the Lakes of Macun.\n\n## Rafting the Inn\n\nIf you want to ramp up the adrenaline, take to the thrashing white water of the Inn River as it pummels through forest-flanked, waterfall-ensnared gorges. Engadin Adventure in Scuol is a good bet, offering half- and full-day tours.\n\n## What to spot...\n\n↓ Hikers explore a remote trail in Val Mueschauns; the valley is a great location to spot ibex.\n\nThe Swiss National Park is the Alps in a nutshell, with dolomitic peaks rearing above high pastures, subalpine grassland and mixed forests of cembra pine, larch and spruce. Edelweiss and trumpet-shaped gentian, Rhaetian poppies, bellflowers and the bright-pink puff\\_balls of Alpenrosen (Alpine rhododendrons) brighten mountain slopes in summer. Wildlife has a field day in this remote environment, including sprightly chamois, ibex and mountain hares, and burrowing marmots. Keep your eyes to the skies to sight lammergeiers and golden eagles.\n\nLAMMERGEIER No bird elicits such excitement here as the Lämmergeier (bearded vulture), reintroduced to the Stabelchod valley in 1991. This carriongnawing predator has a near-3m wingspan. They colour their feathers by bathing in ferric oxide-rich waters.\n\nIBEX With their distinctive curved horns, proud stance and deeply cleft hooves, these wild goats are natural-born rock climbers. You'll often spot them leaping around the heights of the national park at elevations above 2000m.\n\nMOUNTAIN HARE Well adapted to the park's harsh winters, these stocky, short-eared hares hang out among the pines and boulders. Their coat changes from greyish brown in summer to purest snow-white in winter.\n\nGetty Images | Bernard van Dierendonck/LOOK-foto\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-246 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Val Trupchun\n\nBrushed gold in autumn and crowned by ragged peaks, this wild, wooded valley is accessed by an easy threehour hike from S-chanf. The stag rutting is at its most spectacular here.\n\n## 02 Macun\n\nIt's a tough, sensational 16km hike from Lavin to Zernez, with views deep into the Bernese, Silvretta and Ortler Alps. The highlight is the 2500m plateau of Macun, sprinkled with glittering lakes and tarns.\n\n## 03 Val Mingèr\n\nThe two-hour uphill hike from Pradatsch takes in weirdly eroded rock formations, and you might spot chamois and deer.\n\n↓ The 17th-century ruin of Fortezza Rohan sits above the village of Susch.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-247 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nListen for whistling marmots at Stabelchod, hike over rugged peak and flower-flecked pasture to the jewelcoloured Lakes of Macun, and immerse yourself in the culture-rich villages of the Engadine.\n\n↓ A newborn chamois is greeted by its mother; one of the main reasons for the creation of the park was to protect chamois.\n\nNaturlehrpfad (nature trail) for instant immersion in the park's compelling Alpine scenery. From the Ofen Pass, trudge up to Stabelchod (1958m). Continue on up to a crystal-clear stream, pausing to glimpse a glacial moulin in the rock face. If you're lucky you'll see the park's most famous resident - the lammergeier. The jagged summit of 2328m Margunet commands some soulstirring views across starkly eroded, moraine-streaked peaks. From here you descend through the wild Val dal Botsch.\n\n## A day\n\nGet the inside scoop on the park's wildlife, geology and hikes at the Swiss National Park Centre in Zernez. The village's cluster of stone houses is outlined by the profile of its baroque church and the tower of its medieval castle, Schloss Wildenberg. Stock up on picnic supplies Bergkäse (mountain cheese), salsiz (air-dried sausage) and the like - for your hike. Or snag a table on the terrace of Hotel Parc Naziunal Il Fuorn for an early lunch.\n\nDevote the afternoon to the three- to four-hour\n\n## Three  days\n\nWith three days on your hands, explore the park's tremendous hiking territory further. Follow the day itinerary, then on your second day hook on to an outstanding ranger-guided hike, where you'll become a minor expert on the park's Alpine geology and wildlife. Enjoy a well-earned Engadine-style supper back at Hotel Bär &amp; Post.\n\nDay three is a biggie: a tough, full-day hike to the Macun Basin. Begin in Lavin (trains run here from Zernez), where you'll cross the swift-flowing Inn River\n\n## Five days\n\nAfter following the threeday itinerary, spend day four culturally by taking in Romansch-speaking villages that punctuate the Engadine Valley. Scuol, Guarda and Zuoz are particularly lovely, with Hobbit-like, sgraffitodecorated houses, cobbled lanes and fountains spouting pure spring water. Dig into local specialities like Pizokel (stubby wheat-andegg noodles with parsley, speck, cheese and onions), Bündnerfleisch (air-dried beef) and Nusstortorte (caramelised walnut tart). To up the adventure, drive over to ascend through forest. Arrow-shaped peaks like 2889m Piz Macun slide into view as you approach Alp Zeznina Dadaint, a meadow where scenes from Heidi were shot. From here it gets rough and rocky en route to Macun, a cirque ringed by craggy 3000m peaks and sprinkled with Alpine lakes. Clamber up to the exposed ridge of Fuorcletta da Barcli (2850m) for topof-the-world views, before dropping out of the national park. Look for ibex having a sundown snack as you zigzag down.\n\nthe spectacularly lonely Ofen Pass to Müstair. Tucked away on the Italian border, the town is one of Europe's early Christian treasures and its Benedictine monastery is a Unesco World Heritage Site.\n\nOn your final day, go on one of the park's excellent half-day hikes. Try Val Mingèr, where deer and chamois roam, Val Trupchun, and the four-hour hike from Buffalora via Munt la Schera through a one-of-a-kind steppe landscape. Spend at least one night in the heart of the park, either at Il Fuorn or Chamanna Cluozza.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-248 -->\n\nTatras National Park\n\n55 POLAND\n\nEagles soar above 2000m peaks, while lynx and bears stalk valleys below. Sprawled across Poland's southern border, Tatras National Park is as untamed as they come.\n\nGetty Images | Michal Sleczek\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-249 -->\n\nS urveying the panorama from Kasprowy Wierch lookout, mountains consume your entire field of vision. This serrated skyline is where two ranges meet, the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, on Poland's southern border with Slovakia. Peaks higher than 2000m vie for attention, like bare Świnica and three-peaked Rysy. Beneath these geological giants, Poland's Tatras National Park (Tatrzański Park Narodowy) encompasses 23 glacial lakes, as shiny as beaten steel, clasped by forests of spruce and silver fir.\n\nThe Tatras mountain ranges were formed more than 65 million years ago. As ice-age glaciers receded, the region's mountains gained their saw-tooth silhouette of plunging ravines and sharp summits, as well as broad moraines dusted with silt. Beneath your feet, a goblin underworld of 650 caves and karst formations lies undisturbed (except by the occasional salamander).\n\nHowever sublime the views, this Polish reserve has a workaday history. Herders have led flocks among these valleys for hundreds of years. Mining and ironworking plundered local timber during the 18th and 19th centuries. Shortly after, hikers arrived and skiers created a tourism boom in Zakopane, which is slightly north of the park, while Góral (highlander) communities began to captivate visitors with folk music and distinctive 19thcentury wooden architecture.\n\nSome fear the park may become a victim of its own success, but 'tread lightly' initiatives are guarding its natural wealth. Since 1992, the Polish side has been twinned with Tatranský Národný Park across the Slovakian border, forming a Unesco biosphere reserve.\n\nSo after skiing, horseback riding and trekking to glacial lakes on the Polish side, and then energised by steaming grzaniec (hot beer), you might feel inspired to extend your adventure. And across the Slovakian border, hundreds more kilometres of hiking trails await…\n\n↓ The glacial lake of Morskie Oko is surrounded by peaks that rise for more than a thousand metres above its surface.\n\nPrevious page: the Tatras mountains are over 65 million years old.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Mid-June to October is excellent for hiking. Spring brings colour to crocus-filled Kościeliska Valley, August hosts Zakopane's highlandfolklore festival (expect horse-and-carriage parades and singing contests), and September is your best chance to dodge the crowds. From December to February, winter-sports fans flock to Zakopane.\n\n## Getting there\n\nZakopane, home to the park headquarters, is the best base. The town is a 100km drive south (via the S7) of Kraków, whose airport serves numerous European cities.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n212\n\nArea covered (sq km)\n\n2499 Height of Rysy's tallest\n\nPolish peak (m)\n\n270\n\nTotal length of hiking trails (km)\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-250 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Pokoje Gościnne\n\n## Chochołów\n\nThis guesthouse in Chochołów is snug within a traditional wooden building, whose sharp eaves and decorative woodcarving beautifully showcase Góral style. Inside, rooms are made cosy with rugs and shaggy blankets. At the height of summer, the soundtrack to this heritage village is horses galloping across wild-flower meadows. Winter is equally pretty: the guesthouse owners can arrange sleigh rides up Gubałówka mountain.\n\n## Hotel Bukovina\n\nPeering over 1000m-altitude Bukowina Tatrzańska village is this\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Skiing and snowboarding\n\nA century of skiing in the Zakopane area gives this snow hub serious pedigree. Start early to make the wildly popular cable-car ascent up Kasprowy Wierch, at the park's southern edge. When winter pads these heights with pillowy snow, this is Poland's best-loved ski area: the Gąsienicowa side has the speedier lift, though Goryczkowa has a longer slope to thunder down. Between them, there's a thrilling 1km of vertical terrain. Off-pisters, beware: venturing away from the runs isn't permitted on these perilous peaks, and you could be fined (or worse, cause an avalanche).\n\nwellness hotel, which channels mineral waters into its slinky spa and serves up highlander cuisine with a health-conscious twist. Rooms have an alpine-chalet feel, with sloping ceilings and wooden beams.\n\n## Hotel Art&amp;Spa\n\nThis newly revamped Zakopane hotel (formerly the Marilor) is housed in a mansion dating to 1912. There's a whiff of nostalgia about its design, but service is trim and the seasonal dishes served in its classy restaurant are among the best in town.\n\n## Horse riding\n\nCanter across meadows and woodland trails: Kościeliska Valley, in the park's northwest, is a popular location for guided horse-riding excursions. Family-friendly pony trips are available, while sleigh rides operate in winter. Book well ahead.\n\n## Climbing\n\nDoes clinging to granite walls while clouds swirl above you sound like your idea of a good time? If you're an experienced climber, head for the challenging ridges of the Hala Gąsienicowa area. Record details of your route in the Murowaniec refuge before setting out.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWildlife in this region is a snapshot of the primeval past, when wolves, bears and lynx crept through Europe's valleys. Their numbers have dwindled, but these razor-toothed (though shy) predators have one of their last refuges in the Tatras, alongside golden eagles (also increasingly rare). Easier to spot are deer and Tatra chamois, clambering on precipitous outcrops above forests of fir and beech. Above the treeline sprawl wild-flower meadows; look out for edelweiss peeping from limestone crags.\n\nTATRA CHAMOIS The population of this localised species of goat-antelope, with chocolate-brown coat and striped face, is exceedingly fragile. Only about 250 have been counted on the Polish side of the Tatras.\n\nGREY WOLF Sleek in summer, shaggy in winter, and omnipresent in fairy tales, this wolf's sense of smell means she'll flee before you spot her. Wolf hunting was banned across Poland in 1998, allowing these canines to grow in number.\n\nEURASIAN LYNX These magnificent felines, their ears adorned with distinctive tufts of black fur, are far too stealthy to be spotted by casual wildlife seekers. If you do see one, a delicious red deer can't be too far away…\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-251 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n01 Kościeliska caves This 14km circuit from Kiry bypasses monuments to Polish luminaries en route to Mroźna and Mylna caves.

Permits are needed to drive the next stretch of the road, so get a taxi or walk for 40 minutes to Kuźnice. This is the base station of one of the oldest functioning cable cars in Europe, Kasprowy Wierch lift. In summer, it's advisable to book online in advance, otherwise buy tickets here. They are timed to allow you 1½ hours at the 1987m summit - snap some\n\n## A day\n\nLooking for a familyfriendly day in the park? From Zakopane, drive 8km along Rte 958 to Kiry, gateway to Kościeliska Valley. Trails abound through its meadows and spruce-lined cliffs, but best of all is an equestrian adventure with Kiry-based Stajnia Konsul (book ahead). After a couple of hours trotting through the valley astride a horse, seek out a hearty lunch in Kiry: potato pancakes with sour cream, pork with cabbage, and 'Highland tea' (less innocent than it sounds).\n\n## Four days\n\nUse Zakopane as your base for four days of hiking and folk culture. Limber up on day one with a five-hour circuit of Strążyska Valley. Armed with kabanosy , the near-indestructible air-dried sausages beloved of Polish hikers, walk from Krupówki in Zakopane to the valley, following the Ścieżka nad Reglami pathway to a viewpoint overlooking the town.\n\nOn day two, strike out early for Morskie Oko lake. Buses from Zakopane reach Palenica Białczańska, 5km southeast of town, from photos and tramp up to the observatory before taking the cable car on the way down. Your sighs of wonder are likely to continue well into your evening meal back in Zakopane.\n\nThis summer itinerary can be adapted for winter: simply swap the morning horseback riding for a leisurely horse-drawnsleigh ride into the valley (possible with advance bookings only). In the afternoon, bring skis so that you can glide down 3400m of pistes from the top of Kasprowy Wierch.\n\nwhere you can walk to Wodogrzmoty Mickiewicza waterfalls and onwards to Morskie Oko, a trout-filled lake 50m deep. The circuit takes around six hours; for a longer trek, walk via Wielka Siklawa waterfalls, the highest in the park.\n\nOn day three, experience highlander culture. Drive to Bukowina Tatrzańska at the park's northeasterly edge to see the Dom Ludowy ('People's House', or Folk Culture Centre), one of Poland's largest timber buildings; just north, seek out Białka Tatrzańska's church, dating to the early 1700s. In the afternoon, get toasty in 38ºC waters at the village spas.\n\nSpend your final day in the Kościeliska Valley, an 8km drive west of Zakopane. It's especially beautiful in springtime when covered in crocus blooms. Spend your final afternoon in Kościelisko village, after which the valley is named; it's a short detour on Rte 958 back to Zakopane, and a quaint place to toast the end of your trip with chewy oscypek sheep's cheese.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-253 -->\n\nShutterstock  | Andrew Mayovskyy\n\nTriglav National Park\n\nSlovenia's tallest mountain presides over an Alpine playground for hikers and rafters, made all the more enchanting by fairy-tale beasts and ancient gods.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-254 -->\n\nR ippling east from Italy to Slovenia, the Julian Alps comprise hundreds of lofty mountains. But all of them cower before Mount Triglav, the tallest in the range and the focal point of Slovenia's sole national park.\n\nThree-peaked Mount Triglav enjoys an exalted status in Slovene folklore and history. The mountain's distinctive shape has long associated it with a triple-headed Slavic god of the same name, said to rule over the three kingdoms of heaven, Earth and underworld. In more recent history, WWII partisan fighters sported triglavkas , triple-peaked caps inspired by the silhouette of Slovenia's highest mountain. To this day, Triglav graces Slovenia's coat of arms and flag.\n\nSurrounding mighty Triglav, forest cloaks more than two-thirds of the park. The Soča River tumbles between these tangles of beech and spruce, while a labyrinth of underground springs carves out hidden caves. Occasionally waterfalls burst forth: Savica and Peričnik cascades are favourite hiking destinations, while temperamental Govic only gushes when rain floods a subterranean chamber.\n\nThe limestone and dolomite bedrock of glacial lakes such as Bohinj, the largest in the country, was laid down 250 million years ago. Triassic-era fossils of ammonites are easily glimpsed, especially in Studor Pass. Considerably younger are horseshoeshaped valleys scooped out by glaciers, and moraines dusted with boulders deposited by glacial movement. Slovenia's most famous fairy tale, Zlatorog , offers an alternative origin story: moraines strewn with rocky rubble were kicked up by a golden-horned chamois, guardian of a treasure concealed on the slopes of Mount Triglav.\n\nThough it's one of Europe's oldest national parks (first ring-fenced in 1924), Triglav is an outlier on travel itineraries. Fortunately, Slovenia's tourism trump card, Lake Bled, is just outside the park's eastern boundary. These swan-speckled waters and dramatic cliffs are a gateway drug to wilder Triglav: let yourself be lured in.\n\n- ↓ Spectacular Peričnik waterfall.

The tallest waterfall you can tackle is Parabola, a pulse-quickening 45m high.\n\nCross-country skiing Between January and early March, the well-groomed pistes of Vogel, off Lake Bohinj's southwestern shore, are suited to beginner and intermediate skiers. But the most majestic views can be found along its cross-country skiing trails, which wend through snowkissed meadows.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nWildlife thrives in Triglav's arid cliffs, woodlands and river rapids. Foxes, martens and badgers scamper in oak and beech forests, while butterfly orchids peep above tree roots. Meadows bloom with gentians and geraniums each summer. The Soča's tributaries teem with trout, though the otters in pursuit are now rare. Mountain goats, chamois and Alpine ibex defy gravity on cliff walls. Eighty-four bird species nest here, too: gracing the avian A-list are golden eagles and ultra-rare capercaillies (black grouse with scarlet eye markings).\n\nGOLDEN EAGLE Look out for the broad, brown wings of this masterly hunter as it skyrockets after small mammals and glides to lofty nests, usually perched halfway up cliffs.\n\nMARBLE TROUT These freckled freshwater fish are abundant in the Soča but only frolic in a handful of river systems outside Slovenia. The burliest found so far weighed 24kg.\n\nBADGER These earthwormguzzling mammals, at home in meadows and woodlands, are easily recognised by their fuzzy, black-and-white-striped faces.

Direct your satnav to the village of Ribčev Laz, at the park's southeastern corner; from here drive west along the lake's southern bank towards Ukanc. Follow signs to Slap Savica, one of the park's prettiest waterfalls. From Savica car park, it's a 40-minute hike past hulking boulders and charming glades to a lookout over Savica Waterfall, whose waters plummet 78m from their underground source.\n\nIn winter, hikers nonchalantly squeeze past the trail's 'closed' sign, but slush makes the path exceedingly treacherous. Instead of the waterfall hike, winter visitors should head to the Vogel ski area, also on the road to Ukanc. Vogel's pleasant tree-fringed runs, up to 6km long, might not be challenging, but the views are magnificent.\n\nAfter lungfuls of pinescented air, drive back to Ribčev Laz for lunch (or an après-ski Laško beer) at one of the cafes by Lake Bohinj.\n\n## A weekend\n\nCycling is a superb way to see the park. On day one, arm yourself with picnic supplies in Bled village (not forgetting local vanilla cream cake kremna rezina ) and hire a bike. Cycle 4km from Bled to Vintgar Gorge, one of the park's most scenic journeys. Chain your bike and tiptoe across the wooden boardwalks above churning turquoise swells before returning to picnic near the information centre.\n\nPedal west along the park's fringe to Krnica, northwest of Lake Bled, where you'll embark on the\n\n## Four days\n\nOn day one, seize trail maps in Ribčev Laz before undertaking a hiking circuit to Mostnica Gorge.

Take breaks to peruse information boards about local flora along the route to Zgornja Radovna (follow the signposted detour if your quads can't handle the final ascent) and return to Bled for the night.\n\nOn day two, catch a bus to Lake Bohinj, in the shadow of emblematic Mount Triglav. Enjoy lunch near the water's edge before a long lakeside amble. Stay overnight in Hotel Jezero, clinking glasses of fruity Sava Valley wine as the sun dips behind the Julian Alps.\n\nand rafting into a full day of waterfall-tumbling, riverriding thrills.\n\nYour last day is a road trip north through the park. Farmland rushing past your window will be punctuated by kozolec (hayracks), a symbol of national identity. The zigzagging drive takes longer than its 40km suggest. Aim to end in Kranjska Gora, at the park's northern boundary, but break up the journey with a lunch stop in Trenta. In Kranjska Gora, several spa hotels are waiting to steam your weary muscles.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-258 -->\n\n## Valbona Valley National Park\n\n57 ALBANIA\n\nIn northern Albania, the magnificent Valbona Valley National Park is better known to locals as the home of 'the accursed mountains', the name given to the region by its neighbours, for whom conquering this extraordinary landscape was always tantalisingly out of reach.\n\nespite being a national park for little more than 20 years, the terrain here remains stunningly wild: just a handful of remote mountain villages dot the otherwise virtual wilderness, and getting about beyond any of these hamlets is by foot or on horseback only. This is the Albania of legend: blood feuds, ancient mountain codes of conduct, wolves and bears, but it's also extremely friendly, surprisingly accessible and easy to explore for anyone who makes the trip here. Walking options are almost endless, and while paths are still being created and signed, guides are cheap and tourist infrastructure is growing fast. D\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Valbona Valley National Park is that it can be visited on a wonderful loop from the town of Shkodra: visitors take the magnificent Koman Ferry down the valley of the Drin River (created by a hydroelectric dam), an extraordinary succession of gorges that leads to the town of Fierzë, before taking transport up to the village of Valbona, and then hiking the following day to the village of Theth, from where a daily bus takes you back down to Shkodra. Anyone seeking wilderness, scenery and wildlife that can rarely be found elsewhere in Europe today should seriously consider a trip to the Valbona Valley.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go Valbona is primarily a summer park, though more skiers are visiting in winter. In July and August temperatures remain mild due to the altitude, but May-June and SeptemberOctober are also wonderful times to visit, when you'll find yourself almost totally alone.\n\nGetting there The best nearby airport is Tirana, from where there's a daily minibus to Valbona. Many people base their trips in Shkodra, which has better transport connections to both the Koman Ferry and Theth.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n80 Area covered (sq km)\n\n2694\n\nHighest point: Jezerca (m)\n\n1996\n\nYear that the park was created\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-259 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Çerem Path\n\nA good introduction to walking in the valley, this gentle four-hour hike up the western bank of a river takes you through wild landscapes but involves some scrambling.\n\n02 Rosi Mountain A full-day hike from Valbona takes you up to superb views of Rosi Mountain in neighbouring Montenegro, as well as to two delightful lakes if you hike an hour longer.\n\n## 03 Gjarpëri Trail\n\nThis 10-hour walk is a local favourite: you will have breathtaking views for much of the day, and in summer there's the possibility of spotting bears gorging themselves in disused orchards.\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Hotel Rilindja\n\nThis gorgeous little home-from-home is a hotbed of local ecotourism and a hugely popular base for hikers and backpackers exploring the national park. Run by the formidable and enthusiastic Catherine, an American who has made the Albanian highlands her home, this cosy lodge a couple of kilometres before the village of Valbona itself is the best base for walkers in the area, due to the excellent information, maps and other general advice Catherine is able to give. Book ahead in summer.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Hiking\n\nValbona's star attraction is the wonderful six-hour hike between Valbona and Theth, which can be done without a guide as the signage is pretty clear. It's largely an easy walk, with just a few steep ascents and descents, and it takes walkers through the exceptionally beautiful Valbona River valley before climbing the mountainside to the Valbona pass and then descending gently through beech forest to the gorgeous village of Theth. There are several small shacks along the route serving drinks and snacks, but aside from the odd shepherd you'll have this spectacular landscape all to yourself.\n\n↓ The Albanian Alps provide a spectacular backdrop to Valbona Valley.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nAlpine Valbona is dominated by beech forest. It's home to wolves, bears, jackals, foxes, bats, lynx and more than 80 species of year-round bird.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nJust getting to the valley is a great adventure, and the most enjoyable way is aboard the Koman Ferry.\n\n## Three days\n\nThe incredibly picturesque three-hour ferry cruise travels through a succession of gorges. From the final stop at the town of Fierzë, minibuses whisk visitors up to Valbona village, a stunning journey through the mountains. In Valbona itself you'll have a choice of locally run guest houses, all with amazing mountain\n\nWILD BOAR You're more likely to hear these giant creatures snuffling in the bushes than actually see them, though they're a fairly common sight too. Avoid approaching them if you do cross paths, as they can be dangerous.\n\nviews and tasty lamb dinners on the menu. On day two, do the famous hike to Theth, which takes you over the Valbona Pass, with soaring views in all directions. The still very isolated village of Theth - seemingly forgotten by time - is dominated by its old stone church and chilling 'lock-in tower', a refuge for those fleeing blood feuds.\n\nHere the accommodation is more traditional, in stone houses that have been family homes for generations. On day three, after some more walking in the gorgeous countryside around Theth, take the bus back to Shkodra, via the newly surfaced road that winds majestically through the mountains back to the coast.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-260 -->\n\n500px | OZZO Photography\n\nVatnajökull National Park\n\nBorn of ice and fire, Vatnajökull is everything Iceland should be: wild and exposed, ice capped and volcano scarred, but always ruggedly handsome.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-261 -->\n\nE urope's largest protected area, Vatnajökull National Park is a stunning sample platter of pretty much every dramatic natural landscape Iceland has to offer. As you roam this vast reserve, you'll find calving glaciers, geothermal springs, rocky canyons, snowcapped mountains, featureless ice sheets, silent lagoons, buried volcanoes, eerie ice caverns, surreal basalt formations and even wandering herds of reindeer. Sprawling over 13,600 sq km, the park takes up a good-sized chunk of eastern Iceland, so most people take small bites from the edges - from Ásbyrgi in the north, or from Rte 1 as it sneaks between the ice sheet and the eastern seaboard.\n\nWith such unforgiving terrain, access is always a consideration. Public transport will take you to the fringes, but it's more thrilling to get out into Vatnajökull on foot. The two-day trek from Ásbyrgi to Dettifoss Iceland's most impressive, ground-shaking waterfall - will bring you right into the middle of this elemental landscape. You may recognise Dettifoss from the movie Prometheus as soon as you see it. In fact, you may recognise bits of Vatnajökull from Interstellar , Batman Begins , Lara Croft: Tomb Raider , Game of Thrones and multiple James Bond flicks. What can we say - this is one photogenic place.\n\nYou'll need a 4WD or snowmobile to get to the higher reaches of the ice sheet and feel the full elemental force that is Vatnajökull. As you stand amid the silent snows, you can muse on the rather satisfying thought that there's a kilometre of ice between you and the bedrock below... depending, of course, on the goodwill of the molten magma that feeds the Grímsvötn volcano. The last time Grímsvötn blew its top was 2011, with an ash\n\nplume that grounded 900 flights - that's a vivid image, but fire and ice are probably what lured you to Iceland in the first place.\n\n↓ Crampons are mandatory while exploring Svínafellsjökull glacial tongue. Previous page: one of the many ice caves.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The 4WD tracks that cross the frozen centre of the park are only open when the snows melt from July to September, but the park fringes and the northern lowlands are open year round.\n\n## Getting there\n\nVatnajökull National Park takes up most of the southeastern corner of Iceland, with the easiest access from Rte 1 as it follows the east coast. The town of Höfn, just off the Ring Rd, is the most convenient hub.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n13,600 Area covered (sq km)\n\n1\n\nMaximum thickness of the Vatnajökull ice cap (km)\n\n2011\n\nYear of the last, earthshaking eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-262 -->\n\n↓  A surreal landscape greets visitors onto the Vatnajökull ice cap, the largest in Iceland.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-263 -->\n\n↓  The power and the majesty of Dettifoss - no other waterfall in Europe matches the volume of water running over it.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-264 -->\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Hólmur\n\nBacking on to the tongue of glacier at Fláajökull, this familyfriendly farm in Hornafjörður has a surprisingly epicurean restaurant, serving everything from local langoustine to crème brûlée made with farm-raised duck eggs. It also has its own reindeer herd and petting zoo, as well as homely farmhouse accommodation. From here, you can ramble down to Jökulsárlón to watch calving icebergs, or join evening tours in summer to the beaches near Höfn, to sip Brennivín and eat air-dried Icelandic shark under the midnight sun.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Snowmobiling\n\nGetting out onto the ice sheet is what everyone wants to do in Vatnajökull, and the sinuous slither of glacier at Skaftafellsjökull offers the easiest access. Easy is, of course, a relative term. A steep 4WD track is the only way to reach the departure point for snowmobile and super-jeep tours out to the ice sheet, but the reward is being transported into a silent sea of snow, punctuated by outcrops of vivid blue ice - the kinds of views normally reserved for mountaineers.\n\n## Vesturdalur campsite\n\nThere isn't much more at Vesturdalur than flat ground for your tent, and a toilet, but the setting is what you pay for. Around the campsite, rainbow-coloured sands and twisted columns of basalt create eerie obstacles to the wind amid the water channels.\n\n## Hoffell\n\nThe big attraction at this old-fashioned country guest house is the chance to plunge into the outdoor geothermal pools, which steam contemplatively in front of snow-capped crags. The cheerful owners offer quad-bike tours on the Hoffellsjökull glacier.\n\n## Ducking into an ice cave\n\nOn a caving tour beneath the glaciers that slip down from Vatnajökull, you'll clamber through ice tunnels to reach awesome natural cathedrals of blue ice, bathed in surreal light. You'll need a local guide to safely find the chambers among the dangerous crevasses.\n\n## Hiking the Jökulsárgljúfur path\n\nThe trail from Ásbyrgi to Dettifoss is an Icelandic classic, taking in a broad sweep of volcanic landscapes and finishing at a thundering waterfall. You're off the ice sheet, so the track is open year-round.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nAt first glance, the ice sheet and its rocky surroundings seem almost devoid of life, but plenty of animals make their home in this harsh and inhospitable environment. Herds of reindeer roam the higher ground and seals surface along the shoreline, but the plentiful birdlife is what most people come to see, from puffins and pinkfooted geese to gyrfalcons and rock ptarmigan. You might also spot an Arctic fox - black in summer, white in winter - scampering among the outcrops.\n\nPINK-FOOTED GOOSE Among the most vocal of Vatnajökull's inhabitants, these peripatetic geese divide their time between Iceland in summer, and Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark in winter.\n\nREINDEER Descendants of Norwegian herds imported in the 1770s, reindeer run wild on the ice sheet. The deer stick to the higher ground in summer but roam close to the coast road in winter.\n\nPUFFIN Everyone loves a puffin, and these ground-nesting scamps can be spotted on the sea cliffs at various spots around the Ring Rd, particularly in the nature reserve at Ingólfshöfði.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-265 -->\n\n## Drive this...\n\n01 Eastern Ring Rd The section of the Ring Rd between Skaftafell and Höfn offers some of the most impressive coastal views in Iceland, taking in everything from puffindotted sea cliffs to icebergfilled lagoons.\n\n02 Road to Skaftafellsjökull This spur of the Vatnajökull ice cap is reached via a challenging 4WD scramble, but at the top you can slip out onto the glacier on foot or by super-jeep or snowmobile.\n\n03 Route to Dettifoss Two summer tracks run along the Jökulsárgljúfur canyon, with the best views of churning Dettifoss from Road 864 on the east bank of the river.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-266 -->\n\n## Itineraries\n\nThe largest protected area in Europe is its own winter wonderland of ice and snow, with calving glaciers, plunging waterfalls and an almost unearthly collection of hidden caverns and volcanoes.\n\nWatch Vatnajökull\n\n↓ calving mighty icebergs at Jökulsárlón glacial lake. ↓ The glacial lagoon of Fjallsárlón, where icebergs calve off Vatnajökull ice cap.\n\nthe Ásbyrgi canyon, passing through a sepia-coloured landscape of scorched heath and basalt outcrops, before reaching the hallucinogenic coloured sands of Rauðhólar and the honeycombed basalt outcrops of Hljóðaklettar. It's a surreal setting, with more than a hint of alien planet. After an overnight stop in the crude campsite at Vesturdalur, day two continues along the channel of the gorge, skipping over spring-fed tributaries to reach the 27m-high Hafragilsfoss cascade. The final approach to the falls is\n\n## Two days\n\nFor a small taste of Vatnajökull's elemental wonders, the two-day, 35km trek along Jökulsárgljúfur, the valley of the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river, is hard to beat. This route through the northern reaches of the national park serves up a menu of waterfalls and weird volcanic formations. Starting from Ásbyrgi, follow a rugged trail along a sculpted canyon to Dettifoss, Europe's most powerful waterfall, which you can feel pounding in your chest long before it comes into view. Day one climbs the side of\n\n## A week\n\nWith a week to spare, you can roam all over the ice cap. Start with the two-day hike from Ásbyrgi to the Dettifoss cascade, where you can indulge your Game of Thrones fantasies standing on the edge of a thundering precipice. Rte 1 will whisk you east to the coast; stop in Höfn to sample the local humar (Icelandic lobster) and wash it down with a bottle of locally brewed Vatnajökull lager, made from melted icebergs. From Höfn, duck inland to meet the Vatnajökull ice cinematic in scale - which is appropriate, really, as the falls appeared across the full screen in the opening frames of sci-fi romp Prometheus . At this phenomenal waterfall, an incredible 193 sq metres of water thunders over a 45m cliff with each passing second, kicking up miniature rainbows in a churning cauldron of white water. Stand and be humbled by the forces of nature before continuing onwards to Reykjahlíð, gateway to the pseudocrater-pocked waterlands around the Mývatn lake.\n\ncap face to face on the icy tongue of Fláajökull. Keep following the coast road south, to play midwife to a calving glacier at icebergdotted Jökulsárlón and creep through mint-blue polar tunnels on an ice-cave tour. To get right on the top of the ice cap, you'll have to join an organised trip, as the authorities are understandably twitchy about tourists coming to harm in this unforgiving environment. The most popular destination is Skaftafellsjökull, another Gene Simmons-esque tongue of ice snaking down from the main ice cap, reached via a steep 4WD track from the Ring Rd. Fill up on Icelandic grub at the survival hut-like Jöklasel restaurant before hiking out onto the ice, or making your way by snowmobile or super-jeep instead. The sensation of being out among the silent snows is other-worldly - the planet Hoth from The Empire Strikes Back is the best approximation we can come up with. 'Oh no', - skkkkrr - 'more AT-ATs; look out, Luke!'… you get the picture.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-267 -->\n\n## VikosAoös National Park\n\n59 GREECE\n\nSearch your soul among slate-roofed villages in Vikos-Aoös National Park: the spirituality of this northwestern Greek reserve is as enriching as the sight of its mountains and gorges.\n\nxperiencing Vikos-Aoös National Park can morph from tranquil to high-octane in a matter of minutes. On one hike, you'll stand by the shore of Drakolimni, a lake as still as polished marble. The same day, your senses will whirl at the spectacle of Vikos Gorge, plunging 1km deep. By car, you'll trundle over serene stone bridges and then moments later clutch the steering wheel around needlepoint bends. E\n\nThe park nestles in northwestern Greece's overlooked Epiros region, among the Pindos Mountains and close to the Albanian border. Its centrepiece is 20km-long Vikos Gorge, so deep it graces the Guinness World Records list - though this claim is contested. But you won't feel the urge to reach for a tape measure when confronted by the ultramarine Voïdomatis River ribboning between keenedged granite cliffs and past ash orchards and stone-and-slate villages. North of here, the lesser-visited Aoös Gorge weaves through the park's periphery, all in the shadow of Mount Tymfi (2497m at its highest point).\n\nHuman civilisation in Vikos-Aoös dates back well over 10,000 years. In the ancient world, settlements here were outposts for hunters and firewood gatherers. From the 15th century, spiritual seekers fled here. Communities of monks built monasteries whose weathered facades can still be admired around villages like Aristi and Ano Pedina. The Zagorohoria ('beyond the mountain') villages prospered as centres of learning under Ottoman rule, awarded special status in return for guarding mountain passes, but they later faded back into the quiet villages you see today.\n\nThe Greeks treasured the area long before its 1973 designation as a national park. Meanwhile the ecotourism potential of fragile Vikos-Aoös - vulnerable as it is to landslides and wildfires - is only gradually being tapped. Visit now to see this majestic realm before the crowds catch on.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go July and August are most popular, but June and September bring the ideal balance between sunshine and fresh, hikerfriendly temperatures. Ski touring is possible from late December to February. November, March and April are quiet and many amenities close their doors.\n\nGetting there The park is a 55km drive north along the E853 from the closest major city, Ioannina; its airport has links to Athens. Konitsa and Aristi, fringing the western edge of Vikos-Aoös, are convenient bases.\n\nPark in numbers\n\n126 Area covered (sq km)\n\n46\n\nTotal Zagorohoria villages in and around the park\n\n2 According to legend, the number of dragons\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-268 -->\n\n## Hike this...\n\n## 01 Vikos Gorge\n\nTake the precipitous path from Monodendri to Agia Paraskevi monastery, overlooking Vikos Gorge, before venturing along the canyon to Mikro Papingo. It's a tough four hours over roughly 15km.\n\n## 02 Drakolimni lake circuit\n\nLeaving from the Papingo villages, this steep 21kmreturn hike to the highaltitude lake of dragons, home to warring reptiles of legend, takes a solid eight hours.\n\n## 03 Vradeto Plains\n\nOver a full day, hike from Tsepelovo village to the dizzying gorge viewpoint at Beloi, before tottering down the Skala Vradetou stone ladders to Kapesovo village.\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Primoula\n\nFeel right at home in this cheerful, eco-friendly guesthouse in Ano Pedina village.

All needs are catered for with a smile, whether you need ideas for family excursions or an urgent mushroompicking tour.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Rafting\n\nAs well as riding the foamiest stretches of the Voïdomatis River, rafting excursions bypass romantic and ancient architecture. From Aristi village, your boat will bob and whirl beneath elegant stone bridges and float past centuriesold monks' caves and monasteries.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nKonitsa, on the park's northwestern edge, is the starting point for superb biking trails into the park. To enjoy a gentler pace, pootle through the Papingo villages, pausing to bathe your aching feet in the rock pools.\n\n↓ The vertiginous path to the Hermit's Cave, near abandoned Agia Paraskevi monastery.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nAsh and chestnut woodlands conceal foxes, and storks and kingfishers hunt in shallow waters, but the only dragons at Drakolimni are speckly alpine newts.\n\nWHITE STORK These wader birds with blacktipped wings cut an elegant silhouette as they soar above lakes and strut in the shallows. Look out for their large nests perched on trees and pylons.\n\n## Itinerary\n\nCling to the side of the gorge or ride the river's rapids to seek out ancient monasteries and feasts to break any fast.\n\n## Four days\n\nBegin in Ano Pedina to admire an icon-strewn 18th-century church before hiking on towards Lilliputian Dilofo. Unwrap a picnic at Koukouli bridge, a historic span over the Voïdomatis, and then press northwest to Monodendri, where you can visit Agia Paraskevi monastery; its 15th-century frescoes dazzle as much as the Vikos Gorge views. After a cosy night in one of Monodendri's rustic guesthouses, strike out early along the Vikos Gorge trail. Your reward is reaching the twin Papingo villages, backed by the spectacular 'Towers' rock formations.\n\nOn day three, meander the 2km path between the two Papingo villages, pausing to bathe in natural pools along the way. Hike or call a taxi from Papingo to Aristi village, pausing at 17th-century monastery Panagia Spiliotissa on the way, before settling in for a feast of roast lamb.\n\nOn your final day, join one of Aristi's rafting operators for a day tumbling over the Voïdomatis' swells.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-269 -->\n\nWadden Sea National Park\n\n60 DENMARK\n\nAt Denmark's coastal wonder, tidal rhythms expose a seabed teeming with life. Bumper birdlife flocks here, as do humans with a penchant for oysters.\n\nudflats and salt marshes don't sound as sexy as alpine peaks, but Denmark's west-coast national park demonstrates how endlessly appealing (and fun!) they can be, with tractor-bus rides to salty offshore islands, fat harbour seals lolling on sandbanks, and the chance to put on waders and pluck and shuck oysters. Plus birds - so many birds! M\n\nIn Wadden Sea National Park, the seabed meets the horizon twice daily, when low tide exposes flats of sand and mud, and birds swoop to hoover up the buffet on offer (tasty morsels like worms, cockles, crabs, shrimp and snails). Annually, some 10 to 12 million feathered friends use this region as a feeding place, or to rest, on their migrations. That's a boon for birdwatchers, who tick off dozens of species including geese, ducks, waders, gulls and terns. Starlings draw a crowd for their stunning, balletic dances across the dusk sky.\n\nThe history of humans in the region is also on show, with dykes and polders evidence of the struggle to master the watery landscapes. Denmark's oldest town, Ribe, is the perfect base for exploring the park. It dates from around AD 700, and its meandering river, lush water meadows and cobbled streets make it a delight to wander.\n\nAlthough Denmark's national park stretches from Ho Bugt (near Esbjerg), south to the German border, the bounty of the Wadden Sea continues further west, across the great river estuaries of Germany and into the Netherlands. It's a total length of some 500km and a total area of about 10,000 sq km. There are coastal national parks in Germany and the Netherlands, and the entire region is inscribed on the Unesco World Heritage list as the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand- and mudflats in the world.\n\n↓  At low tide a tractor-bus takes visitors across mudflats to the tiny island of Mandø.\n\n## Toolbox\n\nWhen to go The Wadden Sea islands are summer-holiday hot spots, with beach crowds and family-friendly activities from June to August. Oyster safaris run in cooler weather; starling flocks mesmerise in spring and autumn.\n\nGetting there The park stretches along the southwestern coast of Jutland. The region's biggest city is Esbjerg, but Ribe is a far sweeter base. Rail and road links are plentiful. The prime islands are accessed by causeway (Rømø), ferry (Fanø) or tractor-bus (Mandø).\n\nPark in numbers\n\n1466 Area covered (sq km)\n\n10-12\n\nmillion\n\nMigratory birds, visiting twice yearly\n\n3\n\nCountries sharing the Wadden Sea eco-region\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-270 -->\n\n## Walk this...\n\n## 01 Mudflats meander\n\nAt low tide, the mudflats are ripe for exploration (bring rubber boots or shoes, or go barefoot). Note: the difference between high and low tide is 2m, so get tide times straight or go with a ranger.\n\n## 02 Walk to Mandø\n\nGuided walks lead 8km across the seabed to the island of Mandø, with expert commentary. You'll get close to tidal life, and you can take the tractorbus home.\n\n## 03 Nightwatchman\n\nTake a living history lesson by joining the Nightwatchman on his evening stroll around the cobbled lanes of Ribe.\n\n## Stay here...\n\n## Danhostel Ribe\n\nStay in a prime position in Ribe, a chocolate-box idyll of cobblestones and crooked houses. Rooms in this functional hostel are simple and affordable (all have private bathroom); they're ideal for families, groups and backpackers. Knowledgeable staff members rent bikes and promote sustainable travel in the region.\n\n## Sønderho Kro\n\nOn the island of Fanø (reached by a 12-minute ferry ride from Esbjerg), this thatched-roof kro (inn) exudes the prized hygge (cosiness) for which Denmark is famous. It dates from 1722 and has antiquefilled suites (some with Wadden Sea views) and an acclaimed restaurant.\n\n## Do this!\n\n## Going on an oyster safari\n\nOctober to April, join an oyster safari, where mussel beds are combed and shellfish appetites sated. Pacific oysters don't come fresher than selfharvested and shucked on the spot, and the setting couldn't be more natural: wind in your hair, water lapping your legs (waders provided).\n\n## Visiting Mandø\n\nAt low tide, a tractor hauls a bus 8km over the flats to deliver visitors to wee Mandø. This peaceful island is a microcosm of the park - follow walking paths or hire a bike to discover dykes, birdlife, sunbaking seals and cosy inns.\n\n## What to spot...\n\nThe sea itself and the mudflats, sandbanks, marshes and islands support a rich ecosystem. Harbour seals are plentiful, but the bounteous birdlife really wows.\n\nEUROPEAN STARLING Each spring and autumn, starlings visit the park. Close to the marshes, just before dusk, up to a million birds gather in formations that dance across the sky (Danes call the phenomenon sort sol : 'black sky').\n\n## Itinerary\n\nPaddle in the shallows, inspect mudflats, count birds and seals, and slurp oysters from their shells.\n\n## Two days\n\nVisit the Wadden Sea Centre (VadehavsCentret), 10km southwest of Ribe, to get an overview of the park and check out the guided activities - options usually include birdwatching, seal spotting and mudflat exploration. From here, jump on the tractor-bus that runs across at low tide to the small outlying island of\n\nMandø. Hire a bike to get the full experience, and set off on the 10km trail around the island; dykes, mussel beds and seals await, as does a lunch of regional specialities like marsk lam (salt-marsh lamb). Take the bus back to the mainland and, if your timing is right, a dusk viewing of the starling murmurations is unforgettable. On the second day, visit an island: Fanø is postcard pretty and reached by a 12-minute ferry ride from Esbjerg. Or drive the causeway to Rømø and sign up for a horse ride along the beach, or a kitebuggy race across the huge expanses of sand, where your go-kart has a parachute-like kite to harness the cracking winds.\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-271 -->\n\n© Mark Read | Lonely Planet\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-272 -->\n\nห\n\n114\n\n77\n\n© Matt Munro| Lonely Planet\n\n<!-- page-start-marker-273 -->\n\n##
